4,Cosmopolis: the Hidden Agenda of Modernity,"In the seventeenth century, a vision arose which was to captivate the Western imagination for the next three hundred years: the vision of Cosmopolis, a society as rationally ordered as the Newtonian view of nature. While fueling extraordinary advances in all fields of human endeavor, this vision perpetuated a hidden yet persistent agenda: the delusion that human nature and society could be fitted into precise and manageable rational categories. Stephen Toulmin confronts that agenda—its illusions and its consequences for our present and future world. ""By showing how different the last three centuries would have been if Montaigne, rather than Descartes, had been taken as a starting point, Toulmin helps destroy the illusion that the Cartesian quest for certainty is intrinsic to the nature of science or philosophy.""—Richard M. Rorty, University of Virginia ""[Toulmin] has now tackled perhaps his most ambitious theme of all. . . . His aim is nothing less than to lay before us an account of both the origins and the prospects of our distinctively modern world. By charting the evolution of modernity, he hopes to show us what intellectual posture we ought to adopt as we confront the coming millennium.""—Quentin Skinner, New York Review of Books","['Stephen Toulmin', 'Stephen Edelston Toulmin']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6bYgQ26xGXMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6bYgQ26xGXMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cosmopolis:+the+Hidden+Agenda+of+Modernity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,1992-11,http://books.google.com/books?id=6bYgQ26xGXMC&dq=Cosmopolis:+the+Hidden+Agenda+of+Modernity&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,29.46
5,Across the River and Into the Trees - Jonathan Cape Publishers - 1950 - True First Edition,"In the fall of 1948, Ernest Hemingway made his first extended visit to Italy in thirty years. His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for Across the River and into the Trees, the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him ""the most important author since Shakespeare.""",['Ernest Hemingway'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Across+the+River+and+Into+the+Trees+-+Jonathan+Cape+Publishers+-+1950+-+True+First+Edition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2002-07-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],15.0,29.46

12,Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters),"On October 4, 1957, the day Leave It to Beaver premiered on American television, the Soviet Union launched the space age. Sputnik, all of 184 pounds with only a radio transmitter inside its highly polished shell, became the first artificial satellite in space; while it immediately shocked the world, its long-term impact was even greater, for it profoundly changed the shape of the twentieth century. Paul Dickson chronicles the dramatic events and developments leading up to and resulting from Sputnik's launch. Supported by groundbreaking, original research and many declassified documents, Sputnik offers a fascinating profile of the early American and Soviet space programs and a strikingly revised picture of the politics and personalities behind the facade of America's fledgling efforts to get into space. The U.S. public reaction to Sputnik was monumental. In a single weekend, Americans were wrenched out of a mood of national smugness and postwar material comfort. Initial shock at and fear of the Soviets' intentions galvanized the country and swiftly prompted innovative developments that define our world today. Sputnik directly or indirectly influenced nearly every aspect of American life: from an immediate shift toward science in the classroom to the arms race that defined the Cold War, the competition to reach the moon, and the birth of the internet. By shedding new light on a pivotal era, Dickson expands our knowledge of the world we now inhabit and reminds us that the story of Sputnik goes far beyond technology and the beginning of the space age, and that its implications are still being felt today.",['Paul Dickson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XODEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XODEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sputnik:+The+Shock+of+the+Century+(Science+Matters)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,U of Nebraska Press,2019-12-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XODEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,37.37

17,Channel dash;,"In February 1942, three of the major ships of the German surface fleet - the battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen - stormed out of the harbour at Brest on a dramatic voyage back to Germany. Passing through the straights of Dover, the ships faced everything the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy could throw at them. In a dramatic running fight, the ships managed to sail right under the nose of history's greatest maritime nation to reach the safety of Germany. The brilliantly executed operation brought great humiliation to the British - Hitler, who had developed the plan, had judged perfectly the reaction of the British command to the Channel Dash. Repositioned, these fast, heavily armed ships went on to threaten the Allied Arctic convoys that kept Russia in the war at Stalingrad.

33,The Best of Rumpole: Chosen By the Author,"Horace Rumpole lives alongside Mr Pickwick and Bertie Wooster as one of the immortal comic characters in English fiction. With his curmudgeonly wit, his literary allusions, his disdain for personal ambition and his lack of pomposity, he has, in the words of the Daily Telegraph, 'ascended to the pantheon of literary immortals'. Over a period of thirty years, beginning in the late 1970s, John Mortimer wrote almost eighty Rumpole stories (as well as four Rumpole novels). During that time the world changed dramatically with the result that late in his career Rumpole found himself defending hunt-saboteurs and alleged Islamic terrorists. But the old boy himself remained the same: committed to defending the apparently indefensible, trusting of the good sense of a jury and scornful of the law's pomposities - values he carried with him wherever he practised, whether he was defending a murderer down at the Bailey or someone up on a spot of assault at the Uxbridge Magistrates Court. And when the day was over, it was a quick nip into Pommeroy's Wine Bar for a glass or two of Chateau Thames Embankment before the tube home to She Who Must Be Obeyed in Foxbury Mansions. Forever Rumpole contains seven stories originally chosen by the author himself in 1993 as his favourites to that point, together with a further seven from the later period and the opening chapters of a Rumpole novel that Sir John was working on when he died in January 2009. With an introduction by Ann Mallalieu, fellow lawyer and for many years Sir John's colleague in practice, Forever Rumpole offers the very best of Horace Rumpole.",['John Mortimer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yvyjkQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yvyjkQEACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Rumpole:+Chosen+By+the+Author&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2011,http://books.google.com/books?id=yvyjkQEACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Rumpole:+Chosen+By+the+Author&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Detective and mystery stories'],1.0,19.51

42,Treasures on Earth,"Would the world be a better place if human societies were somehow able to curb their desires for material goods? Saleem Ali's pioneering book links human wants and needs by providing a natural history of consumption and materialism with scientific detail and humanistic nuance. It argues that simply disavowing consumption of materials is not likely to help in planning for a resource-scarce future, given global inequality, development imperatives, and our goals for a democratic global society. Rather than suppress the creativity and desire to discover that is often embedded in the exploration and production of material goods--which he calls the treasure impulse--Ali proposes a new environmental paradigm, one that accepts our need to consume treasure for cultural and developmental reasons, but warns of our concomitant need to conserve. In evaluating the impact of treasure consumption on resource-rich countries, he argues that there is a way to consume responsibly and alleviate global poverty.",['Saleem H.

45,The Dead Seagull,"An uncompromising tale of obsession and the darker side of love First published in 1945, By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept by Elizabeth Smart is considered a classic of autobiographical fiction. Set in America, it tells of the narrator’s obsessive affair with a married man and is based on Smart’s real life relationship with the English poet, George Barker, with whom she had four children. It has remained in print for over seventy years. Five years later, Barker published his own account of their affair in the novel The Dead Seagull. In his version, the narrator lives with his pregnant wife, Theresa, in a cottage by the sea somewhere in England. When Theresa invites an old school friend to stay she is oblivious, busy as she is dealing with the impending birth of her child, to the fact that her friend and husband embark upon a passionate affair that will destroy the very life and family she is trying to build. The Dead Seagull is an uncompromising tale of obsession and the darker side of love. It has been out of print for over thirty years and is published here for the first time in ebook, with the support and permission of the Barker family.

69,Existence and Enlightenment in the Lankavatara Sutra: A Study in the Ontology and Epistemology of the Yoga Cara School of Mahayana Buddhism (S U N Y Series in Buddhist Studies),"This book offers a systematic analysis of one of the most important concepts characterizing the Yogacara School of Buddhism (the last creative stage of Indian Buddhism) as outlined and explained in one of its most authoritative and influential texts, Lankavatara-sutra. Compiled in the second half of the fourth-century A.D., this sutra not only represents a comprehensive synthesis of both early and late religio-philosophical ideas crucial to the understanding of Buddhism in India, but it also provides an insight into the very early roots of the Japanese Zen Buddhism in the heart of the South Asian esotericism. The first part of the book outlines the three-fold nature of Being, as conceptualized in Buddhist metaphysics. The author uses an interpretive framework borrowed from the existentialist philosophy of Heidegger, in order to separate the transcendental Essence of Being from its Temporal manifestation as Self, and from its Spatial or Cosmic dimension. The second part clarifies the Buddhist approach to knowledge in its religious, transcendental sense and it shows that the Buddhists were actually first in making use of dialectical reasoning for the purpose of transcending the contradictory dualities imbedded in the common ways of perceiving, thinking, and arguing about reality.",['Florin G.

78,"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)","Friedrich A. Hayek is regarded as one of the preeminent economic theorists of the twentieth century, as much for his work outside of economics as for his work within it. During a career spanning several decades, he made contributions in fields as diverse as psychology, political philosophy, the history of ideas, and the methodology of the social sciences. Bruce Caldwell—editor of The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek—understands Hayek's thought like few others, and with this book he offers us the first full intellectual biography of this pivotal social theorist. Caldwell begins by providing the necessary background for understanding Hayek's thought, tracing the emergence, in fin-de-siècle Vienna, of the Austrian school of economics—a distinctive analysis forged in the midst of contending schools of thought. In the second part of the book, Caldwell follows the path by which Hayek, beginning from the standard Austrian assumptions, gradually developed his unique perspective on not only economics but a broad range of social phenomena. In the third part, Caldwell offers both an assessment of Hayek's arguments and, in an epilogue, an insightful estimation of how Hayek's insights can help us to clarify and reexamine changes in the field of economics during the twentieth century. As Hayek's ideas matured, he became increasingly critical of developments within mainstream economics: his works grew increasingly contrarian and evolved in striking—and sometimes seemingly contradictory—ways. Caldwell is ideally suited to explain the complex evolution of Hayek's thought, and his analysis here is nothing short of brilliant, impressively situating Hayek in a broader intellectual context, unpacking the often difficult turns in his thinking, and showing how his economic ideas came to inform his ideas on the other social sciences. Hayek's Challenge will be received as one of the most important works published on this thinker in recent decades.",['Bruce Caldwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&pg=PA452&dq=Contra+Keynes+and+Cambridge:+Essays,+Correspondence+(The+Collected+Works+of+F.+A.+Hayek,+Vol+9)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",University of Chicago Press,2008-12-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],1.0,34.67

93,On Collective Memory (Heritage of Sociology Series),"How do we use our mental images of the present to reconstruct our past? Maurice Halbwachs (1877-1945) addressed this question for the first time in his work on collective memory, which established him as a major figure in the history of sociology. This volume, the first comprehensive English-language translation of Halbwach's writings on the social construction of memory, fills a major gap in the literature on the sociology of knowledge. Halbwachs' primary thesis is that human memory can only function within a collective context. Collective memory, Halbwachs asserts, is always selective; various groups of people have different collective memories, which in turn give rise to different modes of behavior. Halbwachs shows, for example, how pilgrims to the Holy Land over the centuries evoked very different images of the events of Jesus' life; how wealthy old families in France have a memory of the past that diverges sharply from that of the nouveaux riches; and how working class construction of reality differ from those of their middle-class counterparts.

When newly orphaned Cassandra Dashwood arrives as governess to little Sophy, the scene seems set for the archetypal romance between young girl and austere widowed employer.

Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago.

Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

With wit and intelligence he skewers Anglo perceptions of Latino masculinity and blurs the boundaries between high and low, straight and gay, Anglo and Latino cultures.

116,Signposts,"In this thoughtful follow-up to Simply Christian, today’s leading Bible scholar, Anglican bishop, and acclaimed author uses the Gospel of John to reveal how Christianity presents a compelling and relevant explanation for our world. N. T. Wright argues that every world view must explain seven “signposts,” indicators inherent to humanity: Justice, Spirituality, Relationships, Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Power. If we do not live up to these ideals, our societies and individual lives become unbalanced, creating anger and frustration—negative emotions that divide us from ourselves and from God, he contends. Using the Gospel of John as his source, Wright shows how Christianity defines each signpost and illuminates why we so often see them as being ""broken"" and unattainable. Drawing on the wisdom of the Gospels, Wright explains why these signposts are fractured and damaged and how Christianity provides the vision, guidance, and hope for making them whole once again, ultimately healing ourselves and our world.",['N.

117,Cold Hit,"What if, under the PATRIOT Act, federal bureaucrats could take murder cases away from local cops—then bury those cases so they're never investigated again? What if government agents could bug your home, your car, your place of business—your entire life—with nothing more than spoken permission from a secret panel of judges? What if the Department of Homeland Security could pull police officers off the street and hold them in cells indefinitely as material witnesses—because they're working on ""sensitive"" investigations? They can . . . The PATRIOT Act and the Homeland Security Act give enormous power to our nation's top federal law enforcement officials. They operate under the presumption that these officials are honest, diligent, and fair. But what if they're not? In THE COLD HIT, Detective Shane Scully suspects that the regional boss of the Department of Homeland Security is thwarting a major murder investigation. But why? Robert Allen Virtue can act without oversight or accountability. There's no way to question him; there's no way to way to check up on him; there's no way to find out if he's exceeding his authority. Virtually at will, he can bug anyone he considers a threat to national security, take over criminal investigations, and jail cops. Even if he is breaking the law, there's no way to know it. There's nothing to rely on but his integrity. His professional commitment. His good name. Virtue. That may be a very big mistake. Shane and his partner are investigating ""the Fingertip Killer,"" a serial murderer preying on homeless Vietnam vets in Los Angeles. A bullet taken from one victim's skull matches the bullet that killed another man ten years earlier—an unexpected ballistics match linking one unsolved case to another that police call a ""cold hit."" When the earlier victim turns out to have been an LAPD cop, the investigation becomes very personal for Shane. But there's a problem: Robert Allen Virtue wants him taken off it. To solve the cop's murder, and possibly the Fingertip case, Scully must go behind the powerful bureaucrat's back and deep undercover—where he will begin unraveling a deadly far-reaching conspiracy that threatens to destroy everything he loves: his career, his freedom, and his family.",['Stephen J.

Presenting serious accounts of the appearance of angels and demons, sea monsters and dragons within European and North American history, this book moves away from ""present-centred thinking"" and instead places such events firmly within their social and cultural context. By doing so, it offers a new way of understanding the world in which dragons and witches were fact rather than fiction, and presents these riveting phenomena as part of an entirely rational thought process for the time in which they existed. This new edition extends back into the Renaissance and has been fully updated in light of new research. It also contains a new guide to further reading as well as a selection of new pictures that bring its themes to life. From ghosts, to witches, to pigs on trial for murder, the book uses a range of different case studies to provide fascinating insights into the world-view of a vanished age.

With its military and intelligence agencies spread thin, the United States constantly calls upon the services of these organizations--and Strategic Solutions, Inc. is among the best. After a few bloody and unprofitable contracts, SSI is faced with a financial crisis. Forced to take contracts from less than reputable clients, the upper management and field agents find themselves in a labor dispute. When the Israeli government offers SSI an opportunity to help Druze militias in southern Lebanon fend off encroachment by Hezbollah, they know it's a fragile situation. If the truth were known, the international outcry against Israel would be deafening. Forced to work with a government whose ultimate motives are unclear, SSI takes the job and descends into a shadowy no-man's-land of tangled alliances and hostilities. Meanwhile, Hezbollah elements are planning their most audacious strike yet, assembling teams to detonate suitcase nukes in contested areas of Lebanon, hoping to destabilize the entire country. Caught between two elements of an age-old conflict, the battles the SSI fights may be a diversion...

Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point. Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before. And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be. Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is.

157,Sorrows Crows,"Jerzy was a young, Polish migrant. His journey took him through Russia, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, India, Pakistan, Iran, England and beyond. He met characters including a neurotic Russian girl, a Chinese 'politics' lecturer, Pakistani preachers, a queer old Dutchman and an Indian guru. He developed an infatuation with a Thai 'higher' prostitute and, in China, he was accosted by a vain Brazilian who nurtured an obsessive loathing of the Chinese. During his journey, Jerzy jubilantly discovered the secret of life, but this contributed to him entering a downward spiral ending in total disillusionment. Jerzy, as he roamed, also became more and more aware that barriers to international migration are wicked, dangerous and meaningless.",['Hawaii-Jason Luis Rivera'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ksUdPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ksUdPQAACAAJ&dq=Sorrows+Crows&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Publishamerica Incorporated,2005-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=ksUdPQAACAAJ&dq=Sorrows+Crows&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],,41.97

186,Tea of the Sages: The Art of Sencha,"The Japanese tea ceremony is generally identified with chanoyu and its bowls of whipped, powdered green tea served in surroundings influenced by the tenets of Zen Buddhism. Tea of the Sages is the first English language study of the alternate tea tradition of sencha. At sencha tea gatherings, steeped green leaf tea is prepared in an atmosphere indebted to the humanistic values of the Chinese sages and the materialistic culture of elite Chinese society during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Although sencha once surpassed chanoyu in popularity, it is now overshadowed by chanoyu, despite the existence of more than a hundred sencha schools throughout Japan. This exceptionally well-illustrated volume explores sencha's philosophy and arts from the seventeenth century to the present. Introduced by Chinese merchants and scholar-monks, sencha first gained favor in Japan among devotees of the Chinese literati. By the early nineteenth century, it had become popular with a wide spectrum of urban and rural residents. Some took up sencha as a subversive activity in opposition to the mandated protocol of chanoyu. Others enjoyed sencha because of its connections with elite Chinese culture, knowledge of which indicated intellectual and cultural refinement. Still others relished it simply as a fine tasting beverage. Sencha inspired painters and poets and fostered major advances within craft industries from ceramics to metalwork and basketry. Sencha aficionados, many of whom became serious connoisseurs of Chinese art and antiquities, hosted some of the earliest public art exhibitions. Tea of the Sages opens with a chronological overview of tea in China and its transmission to Japan before situating sencha within the rich milieu of Chinese material culture available in early modern Japan. Subsequent chapters outline the multifaceted history of the formalization of the sencha tea ceremony, drawing upon sources such as treatises and less formal writings as well as analysis of tea gathering records, utensils and their prescribed arrangements, paintings, prints, and sencha architecture.",['Patricia J.

Kirk discovers that these events share a startling connection with the First Federation, a friendly but secretive civilization contacted early in the USS Enterprise’s five-year mission. Traveling to the First Federation in search of answers, the Enterprise suddenly comes under attack from these strange marauders. Seeking refuge, the starship finds its way to the true home of the First Federation, an astonishing collection of worlds hidden from the galaxy beyond.

225,Mapping And Imagination In The Great Basin: A Cartographic History,"The Great Basin was the last region of continental North America to be explored and mapped, and it remained largely a mystery to Euro-Americans until well into the nineteenth century. In Mapping and Imagination in the Great Basin, geographer-historian Richard Francaviglia shows how the Great Basin gradually emerged from its “cartographic silence” as terra incognita and how this fascinating process both paralleled the development of the sciences of surveying, geology, hydrology, and cartography and reflected the changing geopolitical aspirations of the European colonial powers and the United States. Francaviglia’s interdisciplinary account of the mapping of the Great Basin combines a chronicle of the exploration of the region with a history of the art and science of cartography and of the political, economic, and cultural contexts in which maps are created. It also offers a compelling, wide-ranging discussion that combines a description of the daunting physical realities of the Great Basin with a cogent examination of the ways humans, from early Native Americans to nineteenth-century surveyors to twentieth-century highway and air travelers, have understood, defined, and organized this space, psychologically and through the medium of maps. Mapping and Imagination in the Great Basin continues Francaviglia’s insightful, richly nuanced meditation on the Great Basin landscape that began in Believing in Place.",['Richard V.

227,Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary: Japanese-English English-Japanese,"A comprehensive, communicative, and practical guide to using Japanese, Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary is an invaluable tool for anyone with an interest in the Japanese language. It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in mind, whether students, teachers, business people, or casual linguists, and special care has been taken at each stage of its compilation including the selection of entry words and their equivalents, the wording of the detailed explanations of Japanese words, the choice of example sentences, and even its functional page design to maximize its usefulness. What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show their pronunciation. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers using such curricula will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha s Furigana Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with a familiar and authentic kana script. Combining Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary (1995) and Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary (1996) in one portable. affordable, and user-friendly volume, this dictionary has the following unique features: • A basic vocabulary of 30,000 entries covers the most frequently used English and Japanese words • Special treatment has been given to hundreds of words, names, and phrases of special relevance to English-speaking students of Japanese • Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions are explained in clear English • Thousands of example sentences and phrases illustrate how Japanese words are used in context • Special information is provided on verb conjugations, formality, and other aspects of Japanese grammar and usage","['Masatoshi Yoshida', 'Yoshikatsu Nakamura']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3aJNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3aJNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Kodansha%27s+Furigana+Japanese+Dictionary:+Japanese-English+English-Japanese&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vertical Inc,2012-11-16,http://books.google.com/books?id=3aJNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Kodansha%27s+Furigana+Japanese+Dictionary:+Japanese-English+English-Japanese&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Foreign Language Study'],,19.32

233,Like A Sister: A Novel,"In this ""tense, twisting mystery"" (Megan Miranda), no one bats an eye when a Black reality TV star is found dead—except her estranged half-sister, whose refusal to believe the official story leads her on a dangerous search for the truth. “I found out my sister was back in New York from Instagram. I found out she’d died from the New York Daily News.” When the body of disgraced reality TV star Desiree Pierce is found on a playground in the Bronx the morning after her 25th birthday party, the police and the media are quick to declare her death an overdose. It’s a tragedy, certainly, but not a crime. But Desiree’s half-sister Lena Scott knows that can’t be the case. A graduate student at Columbia, Lena has spent the past decade forging her own path far from the spotlight, but some facts about Desiree just couldn’t have changed since their childhood. And Desiree would never travel above 125th Street. So why is no one listening to her? Despite the bitter truth that the two haven’t spoken in two years, torn apart by Desiree’s partying and by their father, Mel, a wealthy and influential hip-hop mogul, Lena becomes determined to find justice for her sister, even if it means untangling her family’s darkest secrets—or ending up dead herself.

237,"NVI Biblia de Estudio para lderes, piel especial (Spanish Edition)","The story of the Bible starts with the simple statement, ""In the beginning, God created . . ."" From that first sentence of Genesis, the story of salvation unfolds in strange and wonderful mingling of the commonplace and the miraculous, the human and the transcendent. But if you were born after the baby boom, chances are the Bible seems more like an item of passing interest than a book of depth and meaning for the twenty-first century. If you're not familiar with the Bible, it can be difficult to put into perspective the puzzle of kings and prophets, giants and seven-headed dragons, shepherd boys and itinerant preachers, Old Testament law and New Testament grace. Meet the Bible introduces you to the full, epic sweep of the Bible -- the characters, the places, the times, the stories, and the meanings of this Book of books -- and shows you that even the most obscure passage can hold relevance for your life once you understand what to look for. Award-winning writer Philip Yancey and author Brenda Quinn are your guides on this one-year reading tour of the Bible. Each day's reading includes Scripture, contemporary commentary, and questions for contemplation -- all designed to offer insight into how the passage fits into the overall story of the Bible, and how it can speak to your life today. Meet the Bible takes you through the twists and turns of the Bible's many narratives, the high points and the low points, the good characters and the bad, as well as the eternal thoughts and descriptions of God and his Son, Jesus Christ. Here are stories to remember, images of real people and circumstances closer to your own life than you've ever imagined. By the time you've finished the year's worth of reading, you'll have gained a panoramic view of the whole Bible and a firm understanding of its ideas and teachings. If you've never read the Bible, or hardly know the Bible, or would just like to read the Bible in a fresh new way, Meet the Bible offers an inspiring mix of timeless wisdom and contemporary insight that will cause faith to ignite within you. Direct excerpts from Scripture give readers a panoramic tour of the Bible’s key passages, personalities, events, and ideas as the Old Testament sweeps into the New Testament. Culturally relevant commentary from Quinn and Yancey sheds light on each day’s passage, examining the twists and turns of the Bible’s many narratives, the high points and the low points, the good characters and the bad, as well as the eternal thoughts and descriptions of God and his Son. Reflections every five days provide life application for the week’s Scripture readings.","['Philip Yancey', 'Brenda Quinn']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QsGyuH87wlAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=QsGyuH87wlAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=NVI+Biblia+de+Estudio+para+lderes,+piel+especial+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Zondervan,2010-05-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsGyuH87wlAC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0,36.35

A Lifetime Ago follows the nostalgic adventures and poignant childhood of Jerry Joyell, an average kid of the 1940s and 1950s. Born in 1942 in Waterbury, Connecticut, Joyell grew up in an era of profound change in post-World War II America. The son of working class parents, he learned the importance of family and came to appreciate the modest yet abundant life his mother and father provided for him and his brother. Whether it was a visit to Pat's Barbershop for a haircut, long summer evenings playing with friends in the park, or picking blueberries so his mother could make her famous muffins, he experienced the beauty of life beyond his front door. Joyell infuses his memoir with insights concerning today's youth, adding a thoughtful commentary on children past and present. From his first memory of watching Pinocchio with his father on V-J Day in 1945 to his final excitement-filled eighth grade year at Bunker Hill Grammar School, Jerry Joyell presents a vivid, evocative portrait of America during its heyday.",['Jeremy J.

Born into the humblest of circumstances, William Prescott is determined to amass a fortune large enough to ensure that his four children will never want for anything. He’ll do whatever it takes to achieve his goal, even if it means plundering Pennsylvania’s forests of every last tree and destroying anyone who stands in his way. As William’s business empire grows, so too does his insatiable need to be loved and admired. William’s wife, Ursula, tries to fill their ostentatious home with warmth and common sense, but her efforts are destined to backfire. The children resent her for trying to discipline them, and William’s ambition blinds him to any point of view but his own.

Among the solutions are 14 results competitive with human-produced results, including 10 rediscoveries of previously patented inventions. Researchers in artificial intelligence, machine learning, evolutionary computation, and genetic algorithms will find this an essential reference to the most recent and most important results in the rapidly growing field of genetic programming. * Explains how the success of genetic programming arises from seven fundamental differences distinguishing it from conventional approaches to artificial intelligence and machine learning * Describes how genetic programming uses architecture-altering operations to make on-the-fly decisions on whether to use subroutines, loops, recursions, and memory * Demonstrates that genetic programming possesses 16 attributes that can reasonably be expected of a system for automatically creating computer programs * Presents the general-purpose Genetic Programming Problem Solver * Focuses on the previously unsolved problem of analog circuit synthesis, presenting genetically evolved filters, amplifiers, computational circuits, a robot controller circuit, source identification circuits, a temperature-measuring circuit, a voltage reference circuit, and more * Introduces evolvable hardware in the form of field-programmable gate arrays * Includes an introduction to genetic programming for the uninitiated","['John R.

Every teenage girl should be given a copy' HOT PRESS Being a woman is, largely, about performance - how we dress and modify our bodies, what we say, the roles we play, and how we conform to expectations. Gender stereotypes are still deeply embedded in our society, but Emer O'Toole is on a mission to re-write the old script and bend the rules of gender - and she shows how and why we should all be joining in. Exploring what it means to 'act like a girl', Emer takes us on a hilarious and thought-provoking journey through her life (including singing 'Get Your Pits Out for the Lads' on national TV after growing out her body hair). Cross-dressing, booty-shaking, sexual disasters, family dinners and full-body waxing are all lovingly dissected in search of wisdom. With game-changing ideas, academic intelligence and laugh-out-loud humour, this book will open your mind and revolutionise the way that you think about gender.","[""Emer O'Toole""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vMCbAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vMCbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT18&dq=Girls+Will+Be+Girls&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2015-02-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vMCbAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],,35.05

At last he is following his own advice to students, to do their anthropological fieldwork 'somewhere where the inhabitants are beautiful, friendly, where you would like the food.' Barley explores the island on horseback and in buses jammed to the gunnels, and meets priests faithful to the old animist rituals. With his customary wit, he takes the reader deep into this complex but adaptable society. Reversing the habitual patterns of anthropology, Barley then invites four Torajan carvers to London to build a traditional rice barn at the Museum of Mankind. The observer becomes the observed. Now, it is Barley's turn to explain the absurdities of an English city to his bemused guests, in a glorious finale to a trilogy of anthropological journeys that began with The Innocent Anthropologist and continued with A Plague of Caterpillars (both published by Eland). A postscript, penned thirty years after these adventures had been concluded, confirms the rich arc of this story-line of role reversals.",['Nigel Barley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9-DZvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9-DZvQEACAAJ&dq=Not+a+Hazardous+Sport&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Eland Publishing,2019-01-17,http://books.google.com/books?id=9-DZvQEACAAJ&dq=Not+a+Hazardous+Sport&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Ethnology'],,12.48

Here, Paula McClain and Joseph Stewart combine traditional elements of political science analysis--history, Constitutional theory, institutions, political behavior, and policy actors--with a thoroughgoing survey of the political status of four major groups: African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and American Indians. They show similarities and differences in these groups' political action and experience, and point the way toward coalition, competition, and consensus-building in the face of ongoing conflict. Two dilemmas shape the book: How do we as a nation reconcile a commitment to equality with persistent inequality and discrimination?

Every God-name, including YHWH, reflects only one of God’s many aspects, such as the loving creator, the militaristic authoritarian, or the all-knowing judge. None embodies the wholeness, the totality, the full Essence of God. Who then are we to speak to when we seek God? If you can’t truly know something until you know its name, how can we truly know God? The culmination of years of translation research and etymological investigation, Rabbi Wayne Dosick’s work digs through many layers of presumption and deeply ingrained beliefs to reveal the real name of God hiding in plain sight in the Bible: Anochi. He shows how this sacred name unites all religions--both of the West and the East. The name Anochi enables us to finally meet the whole, complete, real God--both the grand God of the vast universe and the God of breath, soul, and heart who dwells within each of us. This in-depth exploration of God’s name includes spiritual techniques, poems, guided prayers, and meditative chants to bring each of us into personal, intimate, and purposeful relationship with God. By knowing the real name of God, we can affirm the connection to the Divine at the core of our being.

LOVECRAFT, ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"" Howard Phillips Lovecraft forever changed the face of horror, fantasy, and science fiction with a remarkable series of stories as influential as the works of Poe, Tolkien, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. His chilling mythology established a gateway between the known universe and an ancient dimension of otherworldly terror, whose unspeakable denizens and monstrous landscapes--dread Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, the Plateau of Leng, the Mountains of Madness--have earned him a permanent place in the history of the macabre. In Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos, a pantheon of horror and fantasy's finest authors pay tribute to the master of the macabre with a collection of original stories set in the fearsome Lovecraft tradition: ¸ The Call of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft: The slumbering monster-gods return to the world of mortals. ¸ Notebook Found in a Deserted House by Robert Bloch: A lone farmboy chronicles his last stand against a hungering backwoods evil. ¸ Cold Print by Ramsey Campbell: An avid reader of forbidden books finds a treasure trove of deadly volumes--available for a bloodcurdling price. ¸ The Freshman by Philip José Farmer: A student of the black arts receives an education in horror at notorious Miskatonic University.

It took perseverance, foresight and courage to succeed. The author of this autobiography had done just that. From the age of ten until age twenty-two, the length of the Nazi empire, he defied the evil regime carrying his brother and parents along on the road of defiance to survival. Living in Berlin, behind enemy lines, was full of adventure. Declared fugitives, you had to expect arrest around every corner. There were many confrontations and last minute get-aways. Suspense never ceased. Food and shelter were difficult to obtain. Were it not for some courageous citizens daring to oppose Nazi law, the task would have been impossible. Even with assistance, our little group subsided on the verge of starvation. There was never a dull moment. The Gestapo after us on the ground and the Allied air force in the sky above saw to that. Experiencing over flights of thousands of bombers dropping ten thousand tons of TNT over your head at a time is unforgettable. The bombing went on relentlessly, American in the day, British at night.

305,Women and Computer Based Technologies,"This book highlights the diversity of professional women in education who use computer-based technologies. They represent differences in socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and age. They were selected for this study because they use computer based technologies in their daily work. The conceptual framework underlying this research is feminist standpoint theory. Standpoint theory in this study stems from the work of Harding (1991) who has grounded standpoint theory in eight claims. These claims were connected to clusters that were organized into segments that could be contrasted, compared and analyzed. Themes were developed and photographs were used to operationalize the cluster categories. Methodology used for this study included three structured interviews. The first interview elicited background information. Interview two used the photographs as an auto driving technique to stimulate discussion. The third interview asked the respondents to validate their narratives and to describe their reactions to the feminist perspective. Results of this study demonstrate the importance of valuing women's lives as starting points for research and as generators of evidence for or against knowledge claims--specifically as their lives relate to computer based technologies. Women need to learn to value and network with other women in the use of technology. These respondents' early learning experiences reflect the cultural agenda and an absence of ""hands on"" science activities. They also encounter gender oppression in many forms in their daily life experiences. Although they all had opportunities to engage in computer learning at different stages of their life, the time to learn and the opportunities to access computers were constraints that prevented further advancement. These women educators predict positive futures for girls who are computer literate, but warn of the potential of the increasing power of technology to divide women in our society into the haves and the have-nots.

Yet at the same time the law created the means to escape that relationship. How was this possible? And how did wives and husbands experience marriage within that legal regime? These are the complexities that Hendrik Hartog plumbs in a study of the powers of law and its limits. Exploring a century and a half of marriage through stories of struggle and conflict mined from case records, Hartog shatters the myth of a golden age of stable marriage. He describes the myriad ways the law shaped and defined marital relations and spousal identities, and how individuals manipulated and reshaped the rules of the American states to fit their needs. We witness a compelling cast of characters: wives who attempted to leave abusive husbands, women who manipulated their marital status for personal advantage, accidental and intentional bigamists, men who killed their wives' lovers, couples who insisted on divorce in a legal culture that denied them that right. As we watch and listen to these men and women, enmeshed in law and escaping from marriages, we catch reflected images both of ourselves and our parents, of our desires and our anxieties about marriage. Hartog shows how our own conflicts and confusions about marital roles and identities are rooted in the history of marriage and the legal struggles that defined and transformed it.",['Hendrik Hartog'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cRjXELrzCuMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cRjXELrzCuMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Man+and+Wife&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,2009-07-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cRjXELrzCuMC&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],1.0,29.7

313,The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study of the Bodhi-Pakkhiya Dhamma (Brill's Indological Library),"Between 300 BCE and 200 CE, concepts and practices of dharma attained literary prominence throughout India. Both Buddhist and Brahmanical authors sought to clarify and classify their central concerns, and dharma proved a means of thinking through and articulating those concerns. Alf Hiltebeitel shows the different ways in which dharma was interpreted during that formative period: from the grand cosmic chronometries of kalpas and yugas to narratives about divine plans, gendered nuances of genealogical time, royal biography (even autobiography, in the case of the emperor Asoka), and guidelines for daily life, including meditation. He reveals the vital role dharma has played across political, religious, legal, literary, ethical, and philosophical domains and discourses about what holds life together. Through dharma, these traditions have articulated their distinct visions of the good and well-rewarded life. This insightful study explores the diverse and changing significance of dharma in classical India in nine major dharma texts, as well some shorter ones. Dharma proves to be a term by which to make a fresh cut through these texts, and to reconsider their own chronology, their import, and their relation to each other.",['Alf Hiltebeitel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZUaeAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZUaeAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA697&dq=The+Buddhist+Path+to+Awakening:+A+Study+of+the+Bodhi-Pakkhiya+Dhamma+(Brill%27s+Indological+Library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2011-07-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZUaeAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,49.74

Showcasing over one hundred rare and beautiful ceremonial and domestic artworks and individual masterpieces of this ancient culture -- produced in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, and the Bahamas between A.D. 1200 and 1500 --Taiacute;noincludes examples of finely detailed and polished sculptures carved in wood, precious ornaments of shell and bone, and ceramics decorated with animals, birds, and intricate geometric motifs. The contributors include ten of the foremost scholars of pre-Columbian culture and art, and an appendix features writings from Spanish explorers who had contact with the Taiacute;no. Of Arawak descent, the Taiacute;no -- whose ancestors migrated to the Caribbean from the Amazon Basin in South America during the sixth century -- were the first people encountered by Christopher Columbus. Although they ceased to exist as an autonomous society within sixty years of the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the Taiacute;no -- skilled agriculturists and navigators and accomplished weavers, potters, and carvers -- developed a complex political, religious, and social system, and made a substantial contribution to the biological, cultural, and linguistic makeup of large areas of the Caribbean. To this date, Caribbean communities in the Antilles and in New York and other large American cities exhibit the survival of Taiacute;no practices in their worldviews, religious beliefs, language, music, and food.","['Ricardo E.

333,A Rage of Intelligence,"Do you worry about the future? Are you obsessed over the past? Do you give responsibility for your actions to your emotions? Do you want to learn how to use emotional intelligence and anger management? If yes, then keep reading! The world is bad, nobody can be trusted, so sometimes we need to wear beautiful armor that will protect us from suffering... What does this armor hide? Our emotional part, our heart that expected something else and received nothing. Emotions often lead us to sabotage our chances of success by saying or doing things we often regret. What can teach us how to take advantage of our emotions is Emotional Intelligence. According to the experts, this quality is vital for a career and possessing this ability is even more important than having a high IQ: most successful people have a good level of EI. Emotional intelligence has become a key skill for companies and leaders, if cultivated, it could be improved by up to 70%. Decades of studies have shown that the best leaders and teams have achieved their excellent results by having high emotional and social skills, including self-control, resilience under stress, empathy, influence and teamwork. You realize outrage is harming your life, yet you don't have the vaguest idea of how to fix it. Intelligence is a handbook for everything regarding the emotional quotient, abbreviated EQ. It discusses the different facets of EQ from why we have feelings to when we need them. It explains why emotional intelligence could take you beyond IQ in life, without inherently diminishing the crucial role that book smarts play in your life. It also goes to burst the common misconceptions regarding current emotional intelligence, thereby helping you to separate the realities from the misunderstandings. This book covers the following topics: Discover what is Emotional Intelligence How to Improve Emotional Intelligence What E.I. can do for your family, friends and work Be a better leader; Learn how to deal with anger Why do you need to challenge anger? Have more complete and satisfying family and relationships; Make more sensible decisions; Have a higher level of self-esteem and self-confidence; And so much more! When an emotion is not properly expressed or felt, it becomes like water trapped in a dam. The pressure grows and grows at every situation you encounter while bottling up that emotion adds its own pressure to the dam. Finally, when the dam breaks, the emotional tidal wave that explodes can quite literally run roughshod all over your life. This is commonly seen in people without anger management or who have explosive anger issues. No emotion is immune to the proverbial dam that they can get trapped behind. Unfortunately, when the tidal wave is unleashed, it is often over the single one last drop that broke through the dam. That drop might be small and insignificant, but the entire weight of the tidal wave comes out with it. Ready to get started?

The Oxford Handbook of DBT charts the development of DBT from its early inception to the current cutting edge state of knowledge about both the theoretical underpinnings of the treatment and its clinical application across a range of disorders and adaptations to new clinical groups. Experts in the treatment address the current state of the evidence with respect to the efficacy of the treatment, its effectiveness in routine clinical practice and central issues in the clinical and programmatic implementation of the treatment.

341,Profoundly Disturbing: The Shocking Movies that Changed History,"What the critics are saying: ""Beyond the bounds of depravity!""–London Evening Standard ""Despicable . . . ugly and obscene . . . a degrading, senseless misuse of film and time."" –The Los Angeles Times ""People are right to be shocked."" –The New Yorker From the murky depths can come the most extraordinary things. . . . Profoundly Disturbing examines the underground cult movies that have–unexpectedly and unintentionally–revolutionized the way that all movies would be made. Called ""exploitation films"" because they often exploit our most primal fears and desires, these overlooked movies pioneered new cinematographic techniques, subversive narrative structuring, and guerrilla marketing strategies that would eventually trickle up into mainstream cinema. In this book Joe Bob Briggs uncovers the most seminal cult movies of the twentieth century and reveals the fascinating untold stories behind their making. Briggs is best known as the cowboy-hat wearing, Texas-drawling host of Joe Bob's Drive-in Theater and Monstervision, which ran for fourteen years on cable TV. His goofy, disarming take offers a refreshingly different perspective on movies and film making. He will make you laugh out loud but then surprise you with some truly insightful analysis. And, with more than three decades of immersion in the cult movie business, Briggs has a wealth of behind-the-scenes knowledge about the people who starred in, and made these movies. There is no one better qualified or more engaging to write about this subject. All the subgenres in cult cinema are covered, with essays centering around twenty movies including Triumph of the Will (1938), Mudhoney (1965), Night of the Living Dead (1967), Deep Throat (1973), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Drunken Master (1978), and Crash (1996). Accompanying the text are dozens of capsule reviews providing ideas for related films to discover, as well as kitschy and fun archival film stills. An essential reference and guide to this overlooked side of cinema, Profoundly Disturbing should be in the home of every movie fan, especially those who think they've seen everything.",['Joe Bob Briggs'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-ORYeWv8uI0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-ORYeWv8uI0C&q=Profoundly+Disturbing:+The+Shocking+Movies+that+Changed+History&dq=Profoundly+Disturbing:+The+Shocking+Movies+that+Changed+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Universe Pub,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=-ORYeWv8uI0C&dq=Profoundly+Disturbing:+The+Shocking+Movies+that+Changed+History&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],5.0,37.41

343,Lost in America: A Journey with My Father,"A writer renowned for his insight into the mysteries of the body now gives us a lambent and profoundly moving book about the mysteries of family. At its center lies Sherwin Nuland’s Rembrandtesque portrait of his father, Meyer Nudelman, a Jewish garment worker who came to America in the early years of the last century but remained an eternal outsider. Awkward in speech and movement, broken by the premature deaths of a wife and child, Meyer ruled his youngest son with a regime of rage, dependency, and helpless love that outlasted his death. In evoking their relationship, Nuland also summons up the warmth and claustrophobia of a vanished immigrant New York, a world that impelled its children toward success yet made them feel like traitors for leaving it behind. Full of feeling and unwavering observation, Lost in America deserves a place alongside such classics as Patrimony and Call It Sleep.",['Sherwin B.

347,Satchmo: My life in new Orleans,"”In all my whole career the Brick House was one of the toughest joints I ever played in. It was the honky-tonk where levee workers would congregate every Saturday night and trade with the gals who'd stroll up and down the floor and the bar. Those guys would drink and fight one another like circle saws. Bottles would come flying over the bandstand like crazy, and there was lots of just plain common shooting and cutting. But somehow all that jive didn't faze me at all, I was so happy to have some place to blow my horn.” So says Louis Armstrong, a tough kid who just happened to be a musical genius, about one of the places where he performed and grew up. This raucous, rich tale of his early days in New Orleans concludes with his departure to Chicago at twenty-one to play with his boyhood idol King Oliver, and tells the story of a life that began, mythically, on July 4, 1900, in the city that sowed the seeds of jazz.",['Louis Armstrong'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S7TSDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=S7TSDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Satchmo:+My+life+in+new+Orleans&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1986,http://books.google.com/books?id=S7TSDQAAQBAJ&dq=Satchmo:+My+life+in+new+Orleans&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],2.0,16.38

First, medical anthropology is actively engaged in helping to address pressing health problems around the globe through research, intervention, and policy-related initiatives. Second, illness and disease cannot be fully understood or effectively addressed by treating them solely as biological in nature; rather, health problems involve complex biosocial processes and resolving them requires attention to range of factors including systems of belief, structures of social relationship, and environmental conditions. Third, through an examination of health inequalities on the one hand and environmental degradation and environment-related illness on the other, the book underlines the need for going beyond cultural or even ecological models of health toward a comprehensive medical anthropology. The authors show that a medical anthropology that integrates biological, cultural, and social factors to truly understand the origin of ill health will contribute to more effective and equitable health care systems.","['Merrill Singer', 'Hans A.

364,Journalistic Fraud: How The New York Times Distorts the News and Why It Can No Longer Be Trusted,"For over a hundred years, the New York Times has purported to present straight news and hard facts. But, as Bob Kohn shows with absolute clarity, the founders' original vision has been hijacked, and today, instead of straight news, readers are given mere editorial under the pretense of objective journalism. Kohn shows point by point the methods by which the Times' mission has been subverted by the present management-routinely slanting the presentation of the facts in leads, headlines, and placement; utilizing polls, labels, and loaded language to convey particular views, not genuine news; and staffing the newsroom with hacks who manipulate information to further a leftist agenda. Kohn shows how such fraudulence directly corrupts hundreds of news agencies across the world; and by revealing all their methods of manipulation, he teaches readers how to decipher the slants in even the subtlest of cases, providing an entertaining and enlightening lesson in fraud-busting.",['Bob Kohn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1zHhsTPrN6sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1zHhsTPrN6sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Journalistic+Fraud:+How+The+New+York+Times+Distorts+the+News+and+Why+It+Can+No+Longer+Be+Trusted&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Thomas Nelson Inc,2003-08-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1zHhsTPrN6sC&dq=Journalistic+Fraud:+How+The+New+York+Times+Distorts+the+News+and+Why+It+Can+No+Longer+Be+Trusted&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],1.0,46.76
365,The Secret Adversary,"In their very first adventure, Tommy and Tuppence uncover an audacious plot to destroy Great Britain In postwar London, childhood friends Tommy Beresford and Prudence “Tuppence” Cowley are having a grand old time—except for the fact that they can barely afford a pot of tea between them. With no jobs to be had and no rich relations to bankroll them, they decide to form a joint venture: Young Adventurers, Ltd. They’re willing to go anywhere and do anything so long as the pay as right. Maybe, suggests Tuppence, a clergyman’s daughter, they’ll even get to steal a diamond necklace. Before Tommy can place their first advertisement, Tuppence gets a job offer. Mr. Whittington wants to send her to Paris for three months, all expenses paid. The catch is that she has to pretend to be someone else—an American—and she can’t talk to anyone she knows while she’s there. It sounds too good to be true, and when Tuppence tries to protect herself with a pseudonym—“Jane Finn,” an odd name that Tommy recently overheard—Whittington’s reaction is equal parts anger and admiration. Accusing Tuppence of blackmail, he gives her fifty pounds and disappears. Of course, the Young Adventurers refuse to leave it at that. Setting out to find the mysterious Jane Finn, they stumble into a deadly conspiracy that stretches all the way back to the sinking of the Lusitania and now threatens to undo everything England won in the Great War. By transforming two of London’s bright young things into fearless detectives, Agatha Christie’s second novel revolutionized the mystery genre.

Easy-to-use program walks users through the steps of constructing a concept map, including: Creating a data sheet with assessment/physical examination findings, treatments, pathophysiology, medications, and more Entering medical diagnoses Identifying appropriate nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems Providing supporting data for each patient problem Prioritizing key nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems Determining nursing interventions Building the concept map and adding arrows to show relationships Creating an evaluation summary Flexible programming allows users to customize their concept maps by moving boxes and adding multidirectional arrows that can point to more than one box to indicate relationships. Data sheet feature allows users to record key preliminary information such as assessment/physical examination data, pathophysiology, treatments, diagnostic tests/results, and much more. Interview data can be entered using a functional health patterns or review of systems approach. Data is color-coded by type (assessment, nursing diagnosis, intervention, etc.) throughout the program and in the finished concept map and to help users visually differentiate content and more clearly understand the complexities of patient care. The save and modify function allows users to return at a later date to make modifications to data and/or the concept map. Evaluation summary step allows users to enter evaluation data after seeing the patient in clinicals.","['Jean Foret Giddens', 'Elaine Kennedy']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HceXngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HceXngEACAAJ&dq=Mosby%27s+Nursing+Concept+Map+Creator&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Mosby Incorporated,2005-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=HceXngEACAAJ&dq=Mosby%27s+Nursing+Concept+Map+Creator&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Computers'],,59.72

416,Geometric Algebra with Applications in Science and Engineering,"The goal of this book is to present a unified mathematical treatment of diverse problems in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineer ing using geometric algebra. Geometric algebra was invented by William Kingdon Clifford in 1878 as a unification and generalization of the works of Grassmann and Hamilton, which came more than a quarter of a century before. Whereas the algebras of Clifford and Grassmann are well known in advanced mathematics and physics, they have never made an impact in elementary textbooks where the vector algebra of Gibbs-Heaviside still predominates. The approach to Clifford algebra adopted in most of the ar ticles here was pioneered in the 1960s by David Hestenes. Later, together with Garret Sobczyk, he developed it into a unified language for math ematics and physics. Sobczyk first learned about the power of geometric algebra in classes in electrodynamics and relativity taught by Hestenes at Arizona State University from 1966 to 1967. He still vividly remembers a feeling of disbelief that the fundamental geometric product of vectors could have been left out of his undergraduate mathematics education. Geometric algebra provides a rich, general mathematical framework for the develop ment of multilinear algebra, projective and affine geometry, calculus on a manifold, the representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras, the use of the horosphere and many other areas. This book is addressed to a broad audience of applied mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, and engineers.","['Eduardo Bayro Corrochano', 'Garret Sobczyk']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GUHhBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GUHhBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Geometric+Algebra+with+Applications+in+Science+and+Engineering&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer Science & Business Media,2011-06-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GUHhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Mathematics'],,71.92

418,The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch,"The bestselling author of The Artist's Way draws on her many years of personal experience as both a writer and a teacher to uncover the difficult soul work that artists must do to find inspiration. In The Sound of Paper, Julia Cameron delves deep into the heart of the personal struggles that all artists experience. What can we do when we face our keyboard or canvas with nothing but a cold emptiness? How can we begin to carve out our creation when our vision and drive are clouded by life's uncertainties? In other words, how can we begin the difficult work of being an artist? In this inspiring book, Cameron describes a process of constant renewal, of starting from the beginning. She writes, ""When we are building a life from scratch, we must dig a little. We must be like that hen scratching beneath the soil. 'What goodness is hidden here, just below the surface?' we must ask."" With personal essays accompanied by exercises designed to develop the power to infuse one's art with a deeply informed knowledge of the soul, this book is an essential artist's companion from one of the foremost authorities on the creative process.

The entries include approximately 35,000 citations to provide the reader with historical context, meaning, and usage.

473,Escort;: The battle of the Atlantic,"The pursuit of German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic has long been considered one of the most exciting stories of World War II. This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on ""hunt and kill"" missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. World War II historian William Y'Blood explains that in the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic, to November 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the escort carrier groups' influence was profound. In addition to documenting the escort carriers' exciting operational history, the author also traces the CVE's development and construction and examines its tactical and strategic uses.","[""William T.

It supplies practical information on instruction for each category of the tenor voice; recommends the kinds of literature to sing and to avoid; and provides an effective system for voice building, including registration factors, techniques for breath coordination, vowel modification (""covering""), resonance balancing, range extension, the development of vocal agility, and maintaining the high tessitura and sostenuto. The book also includes dozens of technical exercises; numerous anatomical illustrations; musical examples; the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols; unique spectrographic analyses of such famous tenors as Jussi Bjoerling, Franco Corelli, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti; a glossary of terms; and a bibliography.",['Richard Miller'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eiYrAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=eiYrAQAAIAAJ&dq=Tenor+Voice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cengage Learning,1993,http://books.google.com/books?id=eiYrAQAAIAAJ&dq=Tenor+Voice&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Music'],1.0,38.69

493,Bareback,"This book analyses contemporary gay ""pig"" masculinities, which have emerged alongside antiretroviral therapies, online porn, and new sexualised patterns of recreational drug use, examining how they trouble modern European understandings of the male body, their ethics, and their political underpinnings. This is the first book to reflect on an increasingly visible new form of sexualised gay masculinity, and the first monograph to move debates on condomless sex amongst gay men beyond discourses of HIV and/or AIDS. It contributes to existing critical histories of sexuality, pornography and other sex media at a crucial juncture in the history of gay male sex cultures and the HIV epidemic. The book draws from fieldwork, interviews, archival research, visual analysis, philosophy, queer theory, and cultural studies, using empirical, critical, and speculative methodologies to better think gay ""pig"" masculinities across their material, affective, ethical and political dimensions, in a future-oriented, politically-inflected, reflection on what queer bodies may become. Spanning historical context to empirical and theoretical study, Bareback Porn, Porous Masculinities, Queer Futures will be of key interest to academics and students in sexuality studies, film, media, visual culture, cultural studies, and porn studies concerned with masculinities, sex and sexualities and their circulation across an array of media.",['João Florêncio'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dw_2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Dw_2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT129&dq=Bareback&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2020-07-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dw_2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],,21.53
