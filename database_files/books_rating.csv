This includes making a spiral bound book, and rebinding a store-bought journal or vintage book. The instruction here tends to be a bit incomplete for a true beginner. If you want to make a journal from scratch, buying a true bookbinding book is highly recommended.There are great ideas on variety of journal styles including daily, travel, recipe, garden, artists' sketchbook and triptychs. Each one has a different and easy-to-create binding. The instructions are step-by-step and accompanied by photos.Where this book really excels is in turning your book into an artistic masterpiece. There are lots of creative project ideas and techniques that I have not seen used in this way before. Some include wax resist, image transfer, plaster paper, emulsion lifts, and creating carved stamps.The examples though the book and in the gallery are stunning. The resource and book list is very helpful. It's nice that it also includes a list with email address of all the artists in the book.

This book will NOT help you learn to make books. It also has a lot of terms that it never defines, and if you're not an experienced book maker, you won't know what they mean.On the other hand, I would give a rating of FIVE stars for the art and inspiration. the pictures and journals are absolutely gorgeous. They're too small, though, and you want to see everything closer.But, since this book is called &quot;making journals by hand&quot;... it is NOT helpful for that, and so I give it three stars."

This is a very unique book because so few how-to books give information about ways to make your journal more artful. The techniques described lend themselves well to edgier, more artistic journaling, rather than cookie-cutter scrapbooking. I was especially excited to see explanations of emulsion lifts and image transfers. As a fan of the journals of Dan Eldon and Sabrina Ward Harrison, I felt that I could make journal entries more in keeping with those styles by using the ideas in this book. Plus there are many inspirational photos of artfully done journals by artists such as Teesha and Tracey Moore. All in all, this book was a great find and I would highly recommend it."

That's not to say that there aren't any instructions at all for creating your own from scratch, just that the projects presented are on the simple side and not what someone looking for a bookbinding manual would necessarily be looking for.Now, if you are looking for a book that will inspire you to keep a true visual journal, then you can do no better than to purchase this book! The photographs are beautiful and the amount of creativity contained in these pages is awesome.There are many instructions included for designing the pages of your journal that would put this type of record-keeping in the league of scrapbooking.

(Other books on that short list including SARK's earliest books, and Natalie Goldberg's &quot;Living Color&quot;.)&quot;Making Journals by Hand&quot; has superb, simple, and detailed directions for even the most complex and professional journals. However, what charms me are the ideas that involve simple techniques and found materials... the kinds of things that are kicking around my house anyway. (You know, that box of stuff in the closet that's being saved because, &quot;someday this might be useful,&quot; ....? *LOL*)Sure, make certain your public library owns this book.

The photos are absolutely gorgeous and show a sophistication not often seen in how-to books. They convey a journaling 'mood' and draw you in to explore every detail. The works showcased are thoughtful, inspiring, and truly beautiful.The how-to sections are straight forward and user friendly. In response to those who found this area lacking I ask; Why make a simple process complicated? It never occured to me that this book should be about bookbinding, yet there are many resources offered for those whose journalling takes them in that direction. How many times have I been given a beautiful blank book and felt intimidated by its empty pages? It always seemed so boring to give a rundown of my day, but to do a yoga or garden journal? This has inspired me to begin a journal about my experiences in learning the Japanese language. For beginners this book shows journalling as doable and for the more experienced it is a source of reinvigorating inspiration.This book is filled with so many ideas and suggestions to get you going and it's clear that the author truly loves this art/written form. I think people will be inspired by looking at the artists' works and will feel encouraged to do their own when they turn to the instructional section and see how easy it is. This is a most treasured book to me and I highly, highly recommend it."

(Especially the scant instructions on restructuring a hardbound book and the triptych.)My real reason for writing this review is to STRONGLY CAUTION all readers about the two solvent techniques and the rather blas&eacute; hazard warnings. Blender pens are extremely toxic and have been taken off the market. Xylene is a very hazardous product, as are the solvents listed, including natural solvents such as peppermint. (I had to go to the hospital because of the affects of inhaled wintergreen oil, even though I was working outside on a windy day. Don't do it!) Many of these solvents leave a scent or residue on the pages long after you've finished your project.The book is quick to &quot;read&quot; since it has very little information. Worse, the photographs are annoyingly without depth of field leaving foreground and background of images out of focus.That said, and the reason I gave it a 2 rating, the journals the artists are keeping are very inspirational and artful. (They rate a 5) Jason Thompson should be commended for sharing these works with other artists -- but not for his descriptions or techniques!"

I constantly pour over the pages- the artwork and ideas are overwhelming. My brain is on overload. I have already incorporated many of the examples and brilliantly creative ideas into my own work. It is by far my favorite book and a journey I often take, completely losing myself and all track of time. If you are interested in this process, I also suggest viewing copies of the published journals of Dan Eldon, Peter Beard, Sabrina Ward Harrison, Frida Kahlo,and William Burroughs. My life is a series of visual journals. My emphasis being on expression and not product. I also seek that out in the world and that is why this collection of others' visual journals is so amazing: all these artists and story tellers revealing an inner, hidden, secret life that society rarely gets a glimpse of.

It only took me about an hour to read this book and, even with a few creative ideas(mostly from the pictures), the general content was sparse. Some of the shaded sections on the side looked like space filler (for example, one on &quot;themes&quot; describes a travel journal's purpose as &quot;chronicling your travels&quot;...no way!). It bothers me when writers use pretty pictures to try and pull off the appearance of a quality book.

B000PXNN4C,Pictures of the Night,,AHG16LPAHWP03,Astrasea,5/6,4.0,1026777600,Final mesmirising chapter in fairytale trilogy,"I waited a long time for this to be republished in England. It begins just as the other two did, 'once upon a time', but Bella is actually speaking the words. I was looking forward to this book, not only for the story and the wrapping up of Alice's and Megan's tales, but also to discover Bella's mind.Bella is the most flamboyant and rebellious of the trio: she is constantly compared to Carmen throughout the trilogy, a nod to the allure she has for men and her troubles with them, and she is the one who keeps up with popular culture. However, although Bella loves Elvis and other rock'n'roll singers, she is deeply touched by the world of jazz and the blues. And this is a perfect example of her character: though she can seem shallow, arrogant and irritating, inside Bella is actually quite thoughtful. The agony of the blues and jazz touches her because she has had sadness in her life, the dynamics of the original fairytale being unchanged. As before, the stepmother, whom Bella wanted to love, despises her beauty and does everything she can to stifle her spirit. Therefore, Bella is, in fact, probably the most isolated of the trio, because she seems the most invulnerable. Geras brilliantly reveals the insecurities behind Bella's faade: her doubts about love, just as real as Alice's and Megan's; her distress about what happened to Alice (she was the one, after all, who decided to protect her that first night); and most of all, is Marjorie really as hostile as Bella thinks she is, or is she really being 'melodramatic' as everyone else says?The sense of doom that permanently hovered over 'Watching the Roses' is subtly changed here into a creeping suspicion, as Geras brilliantly mimicks what happened to Snow-Drop in the original fairytale, even managing to get the bit about Bella's colouring. Bella adores to sing jazz and blues, to get rid of her agony, and even the title of the story comes from a song in the story which is about chasing the blues away. The meeting of her 'prince' in Paris, on a holiday after her A-levels, is incredibly romantic, but typically the course of true love does not run smooth and he disappears, leaving Bella vulnerable.As both Megan and Alice's tales reach their end, Bella feels left out, remarking that 'it would never, never be only the three of us ever again'. Where is her happy ending? And why does she keep seeing a white cat every time something strange happens...?This story is powerful, but also sensitive as it probes Bella's mind, her defiance of the adult world and rules as personified by her stepmother, her refusal to pity herself, but also her longing for love, the one who is protected instead of the one who protects. However, it does make you wonder what it was like for Megan alone on holiday with Dorothy, and what Alice did in France. And what is Bella going to do after the end of the story? Marjorie is especially well-detailed: her jealousy of Bella is increasingly sinister, but Geras also ridicules it, and gives the reader the satisfaction of a kind of show-down between the two. Bella herself emerges as a fully rounded character, and the story ends in a very romantic, upbeat way, typical of her. Yes, there is sex, but as before it is dealt with as a fact of life, something that girls on the verge of womanhood would obviously think about. 'Pictures of the Night' will not disappoint fans of the series."

Our heroine this time is Bella, the most flamboyant, rebellious, and wild of the three girls. This is the only one of the books not told in a diary format, which I found to be an excellent touch, since I could never see Bella sitting down long enough to write a journal.Wanting to get away from her jealous stepmother, who is upset because her hairdresser thinks Bella is prettier, Bella crashes at the house of a band, the Magnificent Seven, with whom she sometimes sings. They get a gig in Paris, and Bella runs off with them for the summer, telling her father and stepmother that she's staying with a friend's aunt. She finds ecstasy on stage, and two very different kinds of love, but always there is a whiff of fear in the air. For Bella is constantly meeting strange women, women who remind her of her stepmother, who rave of her beauty and then give her gifts which always somehow result in Bella becoming ill. Then she returns to Egerton for the fall term, and she and her friends discuss their future plans, and Bella does a lot of soul-searching. And the band is getting ready to play one last big show--and this time her stepmother will be in the audience.Bella can be obnoxious, shallow, and callous, but I accept that, because making her &quot;sweetness and light&quot; wouldn't be true to the Bella we saw in the first two books. My only gripe is that Miss van der Leyden does not appear in this book. Dear Ms. Geras: Please write a book about everyone's favorite housemother. There must be a story there."

Lucy gets into all kinds of scrapes trying to convince herself that she has no feelings for Campbell whatsoever. The things she does will make you roll on the floor laughing--going jogging in her work suit to impress Cam, setting him up with the two worst dates in dating history, swelling up from an allergic reaction from which Cam has to carry her out of the Chinese restaraunt...Lucy's totally funny and totally lovable, just like this book.

I'll be honest, I hate to read. The only book I've ever picked up to read on my own was Harry Potter, but this book was amazing. It held my attention to the very last page, and that's saying something coming from a person like me.Enough of me. Let me tell you about this book. A Match Made in Heaven (by Shari MacDonald), is not like your average love stories. Normally they go: sweet, quiet girl meets rebel boy, they fall in love right then and there, and then that's the end! This doesn't happen in this book.Lucy Salinger runs a fantastic match making business. She is very happy with her life, but recently she's been finding herself simi lonely. Lucy does want to love someone, but it's also difficult for her because of something that happened to her in the past. Then...HE walks into her office. This difficult to explain fellow. A man that can only have his inheritance if he is married by his 30th birthday, which is at the end of the month. A man that is handsome and charming and so kind, but he can't be real? Can he?Lucy is nervous about getting him a wife, because she doesn't want the women to get hurt. Is Campbell only using a woman to get his cash? As Lucy goes to tell him she can't help him, Cam decides to quit on her services. Lucy suddenly wants him to stay.

She seeks God's guidance in her business which is ironically called ""Rent-a-Yenta."" She has three sisters who are close and somewhat concerned that Lucy can find a match for others but not herself. Lucy has a vivacious assistant, Gabby, who wants to take on some match making duties if only Lucy would loosen up the controls. Lucy claims that being left at the altar by her college sweetheart has nothing to do with the fact she barely dates. Her loved ones and friends suspect she has some trust and control issues.One morning an eccentric woman comes in seeking Lucy's services for her brother, a shy, stay at home psychologist. The case is presented as an emergency because her brother stands to lose a substantial inheritance if he doesn't marry by the age of 30 which is coming up in a month! Lucy's ethics object to rushing a match. Besides she isn't sure she can help the man based on the geeky picture the sister presents.Dr. Campbell Howard steps in the office to find Lucy with head on her desk and drooling! Let the craziness begin! Campbell is a handsome, trim fellow and Lucy has no idea of his identity as they begin to talk and banter. There is immediate easy exchange between them and although Lucy agrees to accept him as a client she senses some reluctance within herself.Campbell and Lucy are clearly drawn to each other but Lucy insists on sending him on dates. She is somewhat relieved that the dates aren't going well even though she knows she isn't being fair to his search.There is a lot of wackiness in Lucy's behavior and sweet tenderness in Campbell's. But it seems that Lucy's fear may sabotage her own chances to have a meaningful relationship.I liked that the faith expressed in the story is presented as part of the lives of the characters.

The editor then sums up his strategy in meeting the challenges to this enterprise, specifically the need to check the veracity of people claiming Mr. Wilde said such and such in conversation (many of these similar books have tepid sayings claimed to have been heard in conversation. Joyce suffered similarly with Frank Budgeon, and of course Mark Twain had EVERYTHING ascribed to him including the weather). They also address the difficulty of taking lines from Mr. Wilde's plays and novel, in which a CHARACTER while IN CHARACTER says a certain thing which some later call a saying of Mr. WIlde. Mr. Wilde in his own voice may have said it differently, but let the character with all their defects faults and characteristics speak such eccentric foolishness as a character development device.

MacKenzie,9/9,4.0,1236038400,Clash of the Titans,"The 1930's were a time when a major research program reached its peak. Late 19th century economists had grappled with capital theory, money, and interest (i.e. Wicksell, Bohm Bawerk). Those who followed (Mises and Lindal) developed capital/interest theory along different lines. But it was Hayek and Keynes who squared off before all other economists to see which line of theorizing could explain The Great Depression.This volume reprints original writings of Hayek, Keynes and Sraffa during the early 1930's. At this time Hayek held the upper hand with professional opinion. Hayek's lectures at the London School of Economics (published as Prices and Production) won him many adherents. Keynes and Sraffa advanced forceful counterarguments, but little changed at this time. The fact of the matter is that both Keynes and Hayek went on to refine their views. Hayek published his Pure Theory of Capital in 1941, where he made penetrating insight (some would say impenetrable) into capital theory. Keynes went on to win over professional opinion with his General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936).Hayek was in one sense more fortunate than Keynes. Keynes won a hollow victory in 1936, as Keynesians (i.e. Hicks, Samuelson, Solow...) quickly forgot about what Keynes actually wrote and recast `his' theory almost beyond recognition. Hayekians (i.e. Lachmann, Garrison, White) have remained truer to their namesake. It is in this history where this volume has value. Those interested in the history of economics can gain much insight from this book. This time period was critical in the development of modern economics.Somehow the two most prominent economists of the 1930's managed both to lose public opinion as postwar economists turned to a theory of stationary equilibrium that both Hayek and Keynes rejected, and in the name of the latter. Do not read this book to understand the views of Hayek or Keynes. Read this book to see the early development of Hayekian and Keynesian economics. There is a real historical puzzle to solve here."
0226320650,"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)",47.5,AGE0D24AOA97W,"James F. Mueller ""Lachmanniac""",6/6,4.0,1201478400,Good Overview of the Keynes-Hayek Episode,"The reviewer Mr. Brady attempts to dismiss the work of Hayek because of his failure to adequately distinguish between fixed and circulating capital, in addition to paying insufficient attention to the role of uncertainty.This observation is admittedly partly true. When Hayek began his work on business cycle theory, he paid very close attention to equilibrium analysis, believing that any explanation of downturns would have to include equilibrium statics if it hoped at all to be tenable. Hayek brought this belief over with him to the LSE and used it to criticize the theories of Maynard Keynes, who failed to incorporate a robust theory of capital structure into his account of economic disruption(according to Hayek). But if Mr. Brady bothered at all to read the excellent introduction to this volume by Bruce Caldwell, all of this would be clear. Hayek increasingly came to abandon equilibrium analysis in favor of a theoretical view that consistently embraced subjectivism and uncertainty. It is on this point that I wish Mr. Brady would have extended his last sentence into a fuller discussion of the fundamental differences of Mr. Keynes and Mr. Hayek with respect to their overall economic outlook given their beliefs in ineradicale uncertainty. Hayek does seem to place excessive faith in the capabilities of the market system, but Keynes, while justifiably remaining sceptical, demands repeated acts of government intervention as the means of avoiding the errors that attend the arena of uncertainty. These two positions are interesting, if only because their discovery of the uncertainty principle led them to adopt positions that occupied two extremes. I believe Keynes was right in attacking neoclassical economics and its program of economic efficiency in the absence of government regulation. But it in no way follows that a theory of chaos and confusion (uncertainty) should commit us to a position or policy of rigid rule-making. Such activity may very well exacerbate this perpetual state of ignorance that we find ourselves in daily. Keynes, with his emphasis on uncertainty, cannot have his cake and eat it too. A consistent application of uncertainty would, in my view, seem to distance us from both a commitment to laissez-faire and government regulation.Anyway, if the above paragraph interests anyone, then this is a book that is worth reading. The debates between Hayek, Keynes and Sraffa are fascinating, and shed considerable light on some of the most fundamental questions of economic theory. Bruce Caldwell's introduction is worth the price of the book alone."
0226320650,"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)",47.5,A1UI9T8WKJPZN5,"Michael Emmett Brady ""mandmbrady""",3/3,5.0,1121040000,The difference between fixed and circulating capital is fundamental,"This particular volume of Hayek's collected works covers the very important exchanges between Hayek and Keynes over Keynes's theories of investment and capital originally put forth in 1930 in the Treatise on Money(two volumes).Keynes's General Theory(1936) approaches to investment and capital are the same as in the TM except for Keynes's decision to greatly emphasize the importance of the uncertainty of the information and knowledge base(or,in Ellsberg's terminology,the ambiguity of such information and knowledge) in economic decision making concerning future events(about investment in fixed capital subject to technological change and obsolescence) where the probabilities are both unreliable and unclear.Keynes and Hayek have completely opposite positions concerning the differences between fixed capital,subject to the impact of uncertainty in decision making,and circulating capital,subject to the impact of risk,but not uncertainty.Hayek is very clear-there is no fundamental difference between fixed capital and circulating capital:""To over-emphasize the distinction between fixed and circulating capital,which is, at best,merely one of degree,and not by any means of fundamental importance,is a common trait of English economic theory and has probably contributed more than any other cause to the unsatisfactory state of the English theory of capital at the present time"".(Hayek,p.177;see also pp.86,99-100,103-108,168-170,etc.).Hayek's misbelief that he could present a theory of capital that abstracts from uncertainty is in direct contradiction to Keynes's theories that argue[for a modern ,mathematical treatment of Keynes's theories,see any article or book by Dixit and Pindyck on the ""real options"" approach to investment projects that are fixed(sunk ,durable capital)]that uncertainty and/or ambiguity is fundamental and any attempt to abstract from it can only result in a very special theory applicable in conditions where there is no uncertainty.This book shows the immense gulf that separated Keynes and Hayek intellectually.While Hayek would later acknowledge the importance of uncertainty after the appearance of the General Theory,uncertainty has NO impact at all in the final conclusions reached by Hayek concerning investment and the business cycle.Since uncertainty makes absolutely no difference in the final decision outcome,there is no difference at all between Hayek and a neoclassical economics based on the Ramsey,De Finetti,and Savage subjective approach to decision making."

Logic studies the laws with which the tool of reason has to comply to arrive at valid expansions of knowledge.Logic is the tool of all sciences. Logic is itself a science. Science is the knowledge of conclusions demonstrated on the basis of some principles which are either assumed as hypotheses or taken from the evidence of experience. The scientific method is the orderly way of arriving at Truth in a given scientific discipline.Realism presupposes, and thus entails for all further judgements, that the real is given to the subject, i.e., given to the practitioner of any science, and that the real is knowable by the subject, knowable at least to some extent, even if that extent is very limited. The realist thesis accepts that the real can be caught by thought. The result of the thing being caught by the intellect is ad-equation between the thing and the intellect, which is Saint Thomas' definition of Truth.Once realism has been accepted as a starting point, once it has been accepted that the real can be caught by thought, one can and must trust discursive thought as a truthful representation of reality, to the extent that reason elaborates or expands its primary knowledge of the real through reasoning in accordance with its own laws. It is the task of the science of logic to describe the laws with which reason has to comply when it, reason, is reasoning in order to expand its knowledge of the Truth.Hayek agrees and accepts the realist thesis.For Hayek, knowledge is based on experience. As man's experience is limited, Hayek has a profound epistemological pessimism which leads him to a kind of stoicism regarding policy. (page 48)Whereas Hayek agrees with realism, John Maynard Keynes does not agree.For Keynes, it is not reality but intuition (page 248) that is caught in knowledge, or that is caught by the intellect when it arrives at Truth through ad-equating itself to or with the thing. His intuitions lead Keynes to thinking in ""measurable"" aggregates such as total demand, investment or output and to thinking that empirically established values of these presumed ""constants"" would enable us to make valid predictions. (page 242) Such intuitions conceal all that really matters. (page 246) His theories thereby neglect more fundamental ""real"" phenomena (page 197) and displace micro-economics by macro-economics. (page 60)Contrast this Keynesian displacement of micro-economics by macro-economics to Hayek's admission that the schemata of micro-economics do not claim to achieve the quantitative predictions at which the ambitions of macro-economics aim. The science of economics should, for Hayek, nevertheless content itself with the more modest aims of the former because we can thereby gain more insight into at least the principle on which the complex order of economic life operates. (page 246)Once Keynes has decreed that it is his intuitive aggregates, and not reality, that are caught by true knowledge, no judgement that the real thing can be caught by the thought of intellect, no judgement that Truth in the sense Saint Thomas defined it is present, is any longer presupposed in ulterior judgements which, the latter, can be based on any intuition, even on an intuition contradictory to the intuition which originally displaced reality.One such intuitions led Keynes to the peculiar fallacy of believing that a general crisis can be averted by extension of credit (page 119), the fallacy of believing that the creation of additional money will lead to the creation of the corresponding amount of goods, although such belief was bound to lead to the revival of more naive inflationist fallacies which we thought economics had once and for all exterminated. (page 243)Contrast this to Hayek's fundamental point that the business cycle is an unfortunate but an unavoidable concomitant of a credit economy. Attempts to eliminate the business cycle are likely to only intensify its effects. Hayek therefore put barriers to what others have done to advance in a path rather than supplying new ideas opening a path to new development. (page 31)Contrast this again to Keynes who knows that something can be done at the level of his intuitive aggregates and therefore believes that it is possible to adapt the amount of money in circulation to what is necessary for the maintenance of existing contracts without upsetting the equilibrium between saving and investing. (page 144)In the long run, we are all dead, aren't we, Mr Keynes?Keynes was however never prepared to accept the implications of credit expansion. He never recognized that progressive inflation was needed in order that any growth in monetary demand could lastingly increase the employment of labour. (page 248)How could, asks Hayek and I paraphrase, Keynes's ideas continue to be accepted once it had become clear that the temporary gain in employment achieved by credit expansion had necessarily to be paid for by even more severe unemployment at a later stage? (page 248)The answer has perhaps something to do with the fact once one gets, like Keynes, the opportunity to get away with the fallacy that it is intuition, not ad-equation between the thing and the intellect from which knowledge then has to be inferred, which gives us knowledge of the Truth concerning the world around us,logic no longer provides the framework through which we filter common-sense data in order to arrive at an objective ""Truth"" about ""Reality"".At that stage, Keynes can get away with any new intuition even when the disastrous actual (long-term) results of the first intuitions become clear.Science is then no longer the knowledge of conclusions demonstrated on the basis of some principles which are either assumed as hypotheses or taken from the evidence of experience. But the intuitive policy-recommendations of which Keynes had a-priori intuitive knowledge are then being presented as the conclusions from premises based on, or inferred from, principles which are fundamentally contradicted by experience.The scientific method has thereby been repealed and, as a result, there is no more orderly way of arriving at Truth in a given scientific discipline, in this case in economics. The science of economics has thereby been displaced by ""a"" political economy, whatever the latter may be."

B000JOOEK4,The Masters,,A106016KSI0YQ,Jay Dickson,4/7,2.0,1308787200,Campus politics,"C. P. Snow's THE MASTERS, the fourth in his STRANGERS AND BROTHERS sequence, is his best-known book and has often been hailed as his masterpiece. It's been compared frequently to BARCHESTER TOWERS: a valid comparison, since among his many other achievements Snow was also a biographer of Anthony Trollope. Certainly THE MASTERS does seem to have used Trollope's governing plot of the jostling and politicking to fill vacant episcopal seats; but it is in comparison to Trollope that Snow's novel most seems to suffer today, despite its fame and undoubted influence since its publication in 1951.When the master of an unnamed Cambridge college becomes fatally ill at the beginning of this novel, the fellows of his college begin to maneuver to ensure the success of their own favorite candidates for the master's position. The novel is mostly an exhaustive description of the jockeying for influence and loyalty undertaken by the two opposing sides, behind Jago on the one side (that shared by our narrator, the central figure in STRANGERS AND BROTHERS, Lewis Eliot) and Crawford on the other. The competition is fought with fierce desperation, but because it's so difficult to tell what sort of vision either man has for the college should he succeed, it's hard to care much about the outcome--and Snow does very little to satirize his participants, as Trollope did to signal his awareness of the pettiness of the battle. Crawford, we are told, is an awful snob; but since when was this new among Oxbridge dons? Although the characters of the fellows are often amusingly drawn (particularly the two eldest among them, Gay and Despard-Smith), they're also not given much depth. The whole thing comes off as a bit arid."
B000JOOEK4,The Masters,,A2FKJFIDAWZ2LV,S. Dougherty,39/40,5.0,949881600,Beautifully-realized portrait of a scholarly enclave,"A novel set in the intimate, closed world of a school or college (or a convent, or cathedral close) has a better-than-average chance of being fascinating to begin with. Whether a school story is a work of literary art such as Snow's The Masters or Antonia White's Frost in May, a decent novel in the vein of Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days, Kipling's Stalky and Co., or Farrar's Eric, or even the kind of boarding-school story churned out by the likes of Angela Brazil and the author of the Greycliff series, school stories tend to hold one's interest because they are school stories. Generally written by one with insider knowledge, such books seem to reveal not only the characteristics of a society in microcosm, but also the particular stresses and strains imposed by intimate, closed worlds.Snow's The Masters is perhaps the supreme example of this genre. A perfectly plotted and self-contained novel filled with unforgettable characters (Mrs. Jago, the embittered Despard-Smith and the beautifully-realized Professor M. H. L. Gay come to mind), The Masters is certainly C.P. Snow's best work. Snow's college world is no ivory tower. Passions and ruthless hatreds surface as two factions clash over the election of a new Master of a Cambridge college. The power brokers Chrystal and Brown display their practiced adroitness as they machinate to put their candidate in office and angle for a major benefaction from a wealthy industrialist. Political overtones from the outside world (the novel is set iduring the period of Hitler's rise to power) begin to agitate the election question further. This is a novel to read again and again."

Snow skillfully illustrates to us the politics of small groups, and how very different those politics are from politics in a broader sense. This book is one of the Strangers and Brothers series, but it reads very nicely as a stand-alone work. The Masters is a good read, in which we follow the partisan manuvering of two factions seeking different candidates in the school election. Snow's style is straightforward, almost a latter-day Trollope, and his ideas are very insightful. This is a classic, which deserves to be more read."

This novel, perhaps to a greater extent than any of his others, reflects these qualities as ""The Masters"" is a triumph of characterisation. Jago, Brown, Calvert, Nightingale and Gay will live long in the memory and the understated way in which Snow brings them to life is most adroit. Ultimately, however, like all of the Strangers and Brothers sequence, it is a novel about the narrator, Lewis Eliot; the relationship between tale and teller here is particularly impressive. The reader becomes unconsciously embroiled in and fascinated by his life - here is a narrator who is both partial and impartial, intense and detached. The claustrophobic, parochial and insular world of academic life is captured perfectly here. I recommend it highly; for anyone who has read it and enjoyed it, I commend to their attention ""The Affair"" by the same author.

But it left the impression that most time spent is done in meetings and over drinks or meals. Throw in a few walks now and then.

B000JOOEK4,The Masters,,A2YTHMJJJQCOZ,Ethan Cooper,12/16,4.0,1016409600,One Would Think This Book Might Involve More,"How does an assortment of 13 professors at an English university choose the next head of their college? ""The Masters"" examines the personal and university politics that shape this decision through the narrative style of C. P. Snow. This captures a brainy professorial world through heavy reliance on complex and conditional dialogue, acute but unspoken observations, and highly abstract character analysis. Here's an example of his approach: ""His manner was deliberately prosaic and comfortable. He was showing less outward sign of strain than any of us; when he was frayed inside, he slowed his always measured speech, brought out commonplaces like an amour, reduced all he could to the matter-of-fact."" Still, the story, while minutely imagined, doesn't go deep. It's a tempest in a teapot."

Snows works and a part of the series of novels that he eventually called 'Strangers and Brothers'. The overall theme of the novel is the behavior of men in a small closed society as they strive for advancement, respect and authority. Charles Snow was a master at portraying and understanding men and women although some critics have found fault on the latter score. The story, as in all of the 'Strangers and Brothers' series, is told by a semi-outsider Lewis Elliot and when I met Snow in 1970 he told me that Elliot was a man that we could all respect. ""He is 'strangely' above all of our own mortal failings,"" he joked at the bar of the University of Warwick. If you don't know Snow, please start with 'The Masters'. As a background read, find a copy of the book by his brother Philip Snow. Avoid at all costs the terrible TV serialization of Strangers and Brothers. Incidentally, Snow did slightly edit 'The Masters', for the three-volume composite collection called Strangers and Brothers but nothing of any significance. Note the dedication to G H Hardy, his great colleague at Cambridge."

I vividly remember loving them, the situations, the people, the writing. So, I thought I would read them again, several decades later.I was struck by how very much of a time and place they are, and how the English reticence and manners in the first half of last century shaped the conversations and relationships in the novels.Much is made of a glance, a start, or an averted face.Events unfold in their own pace, and the life and customs living in Cambridge and within a college are detailed and evocative.The Masters is about the succession plans for the leadership in a college when the master is dying, and when he does die, how the decision is made by the fellows. It is decidedly a period piece, but once into it, there is something compelling about the world and the people created by Snow."

Roy Calvert is a student of the Master and a beloved friend of the family. It is believed that the Master's daughter Joan is half in love with Calvert. The Master's wife, Lady Muriel, decides to keep the true state of things a secret from the Master. The Master is to be told he has an ulcer and needs rest.Brown orders a bottle of claret to celebrate the achievement of Winslow's son. Young Luke and the other named members of the college discuss the Master's circumstances. Crystal and Brown are both capable of running things. They believe a Master can be found inside the college. It is believed that Crawford and Jago will be considered for the post.It is learned that Nightingale and Pilbrow are back from vacation. The oldest among them, Gay, is subject to a flickering memory. He seems to forget that Royce is the current Master. Nightingale has been frustrated, unlucky, and envy has never left him alone. He is a theoretical chemist. At one time he had promise. Roy Calvert has always found the intimate formality of the college humorous.Lewis says that his choice is Jago. Arthur Brown is for Jago and Chrystal thinks he can manage him. Brown actively dislikes Crawford and has regard for Jago. Brown is a politician by nature. Brown, Eliot, and Chrystal go to see Jago. Mrs. Jago is a sensitive sort who with her temperament drives Jago's friends away from him. It is anticipated that Crawford, Despard, and Winslow will be opposed to having Jago as the Master. Jago is more extravagant than many men and loves display more.Francis Getliffe, a scientist and Lewis's particular friend, says that he is worried about the talk of Jago as Master. Getliffe would rather have someone of the left fill the office and would rather support a scientist. Jago is an English scholar with an interest in the colonial figure William Bradford.Roy Calvert becomes Lady Muriel's mainstay in the nearly year-long process of the death of her husband. Nightingale wants to get a college office out of the change and Jago is disinclined to see such a thing happen. Following a feast held for a potential benefactor of the college, the Master is told the true medical view of his health. He says that it is hard to think without a future.The group supporting Jago loses its clear majority when Nightingale goes over to the other side. The Master lives for a longer time than expected. Winslow's son fails the final examination although the nephew of the expected benefactor gains a third class degree. With Winslow downcast, Roy Calvert, consumed by his own depression, speaks wildly to him.Jago's pride is mountainous. His diffidence is intense. He is vulnerable. He has never used his powers, he has never been able to compete. Pilbrow, after traveling abroad and in view of national and international issues, decides to shift his vote from Jago to Crawford. There seems to be a deadlock.Chrystal suggests a third candidate-- Brown. Chrystal announces he is moving his vote over to Crawford. Perhaps envy and pique and vanity changed the circumstances of voting for Chrystal. Jago is easier with proteges than with friends. He has a proud nature and is unable to unbend.The nuances of character and circumstances are fascinating in this novel. This skeletal summary of the plot is insufficient to demonstrate that the reader comes to care deeply about the outcome of the election described in full by the author."

It presents 2 main concepts: first, agricultural involution, a significant form of intensification but which may not bring actual development; and second, the divide between irrigated and swidden (slash & burn) farming. He develops these ideas with clarity and authority, enough to have inspired many comments and some revision, but the book's core remains permanently valuable. Both concepts have applications beyond Indonesia and wet-rice regions, and his historical approach provides essential time depth. Clearly Geertz's 1950s sojourn in the Indies was among the most fruitful fieldwork stints ever, producing a raft of classic books and essays. ""The Religion of Java"" is merely one among these, while F. Bray, ""The Rice Economies"" is very useful for context."

0140513485,The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition,11.31,A3E9M9OO7Y2KKN,J. Gentry,39/42,5.0,1153267200,Dynamic Maps - hurrah!,"As an avid devourer of both history and maps I can say that this book fills a certain niche within my appetite that has not been addressed by either thick historical reference materials or other historical atlases.Specifically, the strength of this book (whatever its other failings are) is that it does the best job I've yet seen of presenting a TRULY DYNAMIC VIEW of the area in question. [For caveats as to its limitations, skip to the bottom of the review.]This means that, after the early stuff is gotten out of the way (your neolithic revolution and other early times for which our information is sketchy, which involves leaving out a lot of time), we are treated to a map of the same area at regular ~50 year intervals. [The actual intervals between maps actually ranges from 15 to 100 in some cases, but ~50 is probably the mean.]Now I own a few other historical atlases, many of which come highly recommended (The 2005 Oxford Atlas of World History, for example, as well as a few other comparable atlases), and while they are valuable purchases in their own right, they do not present a detailed DYNAMIC view of any part of the world, let alone sticking with one piece of it. The Oxford Atlas presents 'The Roman Empire' in two (admittedly large) pages that are supposed to take us from 500BC to 400AD, accompanied by three maps. While the simple narrative tells us what happens within that time period, we do not get to SEE what happens. Another atlas presents one very large and well detailed world map for every 250 year interval - empires pop up from nowhere like dandelions and are gone by the next map as if they never were!In contrast, McEvedy's work sacrifices global scope and global time to present a limited frame of reference (Europe, North Africa, the Near East/Iran and half of the Eurasian steppe) and gives us a blow-by-blow account of what exactly was going on. We can actually see Rome growing over the course of 20 or so maps covering a thousand years, not to mention the ebb and flow of the various other historical peoples that shared the stage with Rome. [This doesn't take into account the pre-Rome maps that make up the other half of the book.]I have yet to encounter any other series of maps, in proper historical reference materials or in other historical atlases, that provide this glimpse into a dynamic world that changed with each human generation (as all human communities do, whether we know it or not). [If anyone else knows of such a series of maps, by all means post a review listing the title.]As an amateur scholar who prefers to get proper historical information from thick, specifically targeted thousand page works, I can definitely say that there is no substitute for the visual information that maps can provide. I've lost count of how many pages have been wasted attempting to explain in (many, many) words what could have been presented instantly and without confusion by a simple well drawn and well-excised map - in fact I've yet to encounter any proper historical work in which the use of maps has been what I'd call adequate. Every targeted proper history should have a section of dynamic maps as comprehensive in time (50 year snapshots) as McEvedy's work, and without all the clutter added in. [If the entire historical narrative never even mentions cities G-Z, why are cities G-Z included in the maps at all - to make cities A-F difficult to find?]Finally, McEvedy certainly has a way with words, as well as a sense of humor, which makes the narrative, simple as it is, more enjoyable then your average millenium trudge.Having said all this, however, one should keep in mind that this Atlas fills a specific and so far unmet need - without competition in that specific realm it stands unparalleled. When measured according to other parameters that are already serviced by other products, this Atlas is average at best.Factors to consider:1) Can only be classified as the most basic of introductions to history - the historical narrative is very very simple, easily outclassed by other atlases, and is primarily meant to simply accompany the maps and explain any apparent anomalies. This is not a book with which to learn history, but to offer a supplement to the amateur historian that simply isn't available elsewhere (at least not collected into one convenient place that I am aware of).2) Limited in geographical scope. Relatively clearly stated at the outset. I, personally, would love to see the same treatment given to the rest of the world (either as a whole or by region or both), but this has not been attempted. [Cursory book store inspection of the regional Penguin Atlases, such as Africa or Egypt or Greece, suggest that they have moved away from the dynamic presentation of many maps towards a more narrative approach.]3) Lack of detail. This is not a standard reference work - it is not a book with which to look up specific facts or places or cities. It details the movements of large numbers of people who are defined in cultural/linguistic terms - it is a work of demographic history, and in terms of such, excess detail would indeed simply get in the way of the purpose of THIS work. Other Atlases and dictionaries have already provided reference services.4) The author is not precisely a neutral party. Whil McEvedy's specialization involves demographic history, in which I do not doubt he is both objective and an expert, he is not afraid to stake out a position on other issues in history about which he may not be such an expert. If certain historical controversies tend to set you off (such as the Aryan invasion conroversy), then you may well be set off by some of the random comments interspersed throughout the book. McEvedy's opinions clearly represent that backlash against the historical-PC movement (or whatever it might be called), in which there have never been any real Dark Ages anywhere at any time (as this would insult the people who lived at those times, making them seem inferior), and in which large regions were never invaded by other people (as this is a threat to the patriots of [Nation X], however long ago it didn't happen), or if they were invaded the 'invaders' were really friendly and nice and accomodating (not ambitious, opportunistic and clever thugs, because thugs are never smart), or that the invaders clearly made no useful or worthwhile contributions to subsequent cultural development (because aggression and invasion are wrong, and the perpetrators should not be encouraged by admitting that they were anything except pure destructive evil). Of course such theories began, some time ago, as a response to the old conservative position in which fresh blood and racial superiority demanded that invasions determined everything (because muscles are good), that the conquered people were weak, stupid, insipid and given to orgies and all manner of archaic and disgusting customs (and probably used masking tape to fix their glasses), that the conquerors were massive and virile noble savages (full of honor and repute and definitely not a collection of rapists and murderers), and that the conquered people were usually dissolved in the pure elixir of new blood (or at least kept where they belonged, in slavery).Seen in the light of past and present exremisms, McEvedy's comments are pretty tame, and more of a calling for balance between various hypotheses (which, when left to themselves, tend to become hyperbolic). In any case such few comments as exist are not integral to any theory presented by McEvedy, and are really no more than asides to the work - most authors would excise such unnecessary and provocative comments, but McEvedy has not. The comments are almost meaningless to the purpose of the book, so you can easily take the maps and forget the narrative completely, and still come out ahead, regardless of your position.In summary, and speaking as an amateur historian, this book is an amazing kind of supplement that I have yet find anywhere else. It is not, however, a comprehensive introduction to world (or regional) history, and it is not a general reference work."

The language is a pure joy: Caesar's son being ""tidied away into a small box""; Nero ""dying by his own shaky hand""; the ""proud and prickly"" Great Kings of Persia. The book (and others by the same author) is also refreshingly politically incorrect: unashamedly European in outlook, rightly contemptuous of less civilized polities, unafraid to defend the Indo-European conquest of Iran and Northern India.Best of all, the maps are a succulent treat: I remember tracing them out by pencil when a student (that was the first edition) and being caught out by my history master - leading to a heated debate on the origin of the Etruscans.I have now gone through no less than seven copies of this book (first or second edition): three given away to enlightened friends, four disintegrated through long re-readings in the bath.A Gibbon for the IT age."

My only complaint is that some of the text is outdated; the 2nd Edition is from 2002 but it fails to incorporate some of the newer discoveries. The text on the Indus Valley Civilization (discovery of only two cities) and the Aryan entry into India (states definitively that they invaded and destroyed the IVC, when this is questioned) are the most blatant examples. Still, most of the text and maps are very useful and still current. If you like ancient history, this book is for you."

Firstly the scope covers a mere 40,000 years of mainly European and Middle Eastern history. From the stone age to Byzantium. Secondly you get a swift and understandable summary of all those peoples you should know about but don't; the Medes, the Cimmarians, the Ostrogoths and hundreds of others. Thirdly, as well as the military and political history which helped create the world of today, for just a few quid you get a history of population developement, a history of trade and the story of the development and spread of both language and literacy. Wow!On top of all this, the book is written in witty and self-depreciating style, explaining carefully where the evidence may be contradictory or simply absent.

I have been an owner of virtually all of them for at ten years and I can honestly say that they are most read books of all that I own.The reason is their unique portability and scope. Most historical atlas are huge, heavy and expensive. They are difficult to read unless you are sitting at a table and very difficult to carry. This limits their utility (even though I still love them). Most history books have lots of dense detail about one nation or one period. Virtually none cover the broad sweep of an entire region over centuries.This atlas covers Europe, the Middle East, western Russia, the Horn of Africa and the Indus River Valley. It starts in 40,000 BC and finishes in AD 362. In all, it has a more than 50 maps. The frequency of the maps increases as we get closer to the modern era.Like all Penguin Historical Atlases, it is small, light, reasonably priced and incredibly broad in scope. These atlases offer a unique perspective on history than is otherwise impossible to achieve. Their size and weight make them perfect for travelling. Whenever I go on a trip, I take the most relevant ones with me. That way I can brush up on my history of the region.The format is extremely useful. Each two-page layout represents a specific time period. On the right is a historical map. On the left is a very brief overview of the important events that happened since the previous map. Each event usually consists of one paragraph or at most a few paragraphs, just enough to peak the interest. Most of the maps document boundaries and note a few key cities or battlegrounds. Occasionally, the maps focus on population, religion or economics.What is most fun for me is to trace the history or one nation, province or sub-region through the entire atlas. In just a few minutes I can learn as much as spending days reading an entire book. You can also see how individual nations interact with each other, a subject often left out of typical history books."

This book is very unlike any other relationship book I have read thus far, (from the Christian perspective anyhow, some of Dr. Crabb's sentiments about gender differences are echoed by Dr. Laura, John Gray, and others). His approach to explaining differences is both humble and enticing. For women who struggle to overcome a very feminist background in which the term ""submission"" causes the hair on our neck to rise, his book is palpable and invites one to examine his or her motives.Dr. Crabb's explanations are such that your mind and heart remain open to receiving something profound. This book is beneficial not just for individuals struggling in relationships, but singles as well, the premise being one that reminds us that our main enemy in life is selfishness and the only freedom from a life lived in a self-centered prison is one which focuses on other-centered living: how true, and how simple.

And several things I can wholeheartedly agree with:1. A lot of marital unhappiness can come from being too self-centered and not other-centered enough.2. A person's needs for security and significance are ultimately met in his or her personal relationship to God through Jesus Christ, and this is the most important part of life to nurture and build.Beyond that, though, I have a problem with a basic idea in Dr. Crabb's thinking. He asserts that a man's main need is ""significance"" and a woman's main need is ""security."" And I think that he makes this into too much of a system. While he will say that men need security and women need significance, I think he arbitrarily names men's desires ""significance"" and a woman's desires ""security"" when they may not be. I've always been leery of stereotyping people.Now I must admit that as a woman I like security -- especially financial! And I like the ""security"" of being loved by my husband. But I still want to make some accomplishments in life apart from who I'm married to. I'm a writer, musician and teacher, and those make up as much of my life as my domestic side, and recognition in these areas will probably be more important to my SIGNIFICANCE desire than my SECURITY desire -- unless, of course, I receive a large cash award and that will make me feel more SECURE!

He supports his points by scriptural reference, by referring to his counseling, and to common sense.If you don't like his goal, if you have the modern view of such things, this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire, he is, above all, plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree, even vehemently disagree, with his views, it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book, whatever your position, with reason, logic, and fact, and you will know more about, among other things, what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels, but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that, if men and women are to take gender-separate roles, the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace, or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work, or a supervisor.

B0006APJFA,The real life of Sebastian Knight,,A2YTHMJJJQCOZ,Ethan Cooper,1/1,4.0,1245024000,Literate Playfulness,"V, the narrator of THE REAL LIFE OF SEBASTIAN KNIGHT, has spent little time with his older half-brother, the accomplished but obscure novelist Sebastian Knight. But shortly after Sebastian's too-early death, a biography, ""The Tragedy of Sebastian Knight"", appears that V considers a ""slapdash and very misleading book."" In response, the strangely loving V commences to research his own book about Sebastian, THE REAL LIFE OF SEBASTIAN KNIGHT. Problem is: V doesn't know Sebastian well. There are a few memories of childhood and the occasional interactions of the distant brothers. Otherwise, V has to rely on Sebastian's five novels, and some gumshoe work, to ""bring up his life bit by bit... soldering the fragments with my inner knowledge of his character.""Basically, Nabokov splits this quest, V's effort to capture his brother's real life, into two narrative elements. The first element, insightful commentary on Sebastian's five novels, is probably a bit of a stretch for many fans of The Nab. Here, V highlights passages from Sebastian's novels and then surrounds them with amazing interpretation, which V says illuminates Sebastian's talent, values, and character. This is certainly an opportunity for Nabokov to offer brilliant fragments. And, this reads like a dazzling spoof of literary criticism and connoisseurship. (Are you reading this, James Wood?) Still, there are moments when V, darting from fragment to fragment in his outpourings of enthusiasm, is hard to follow. Sad to say: but for this reader, this element of the quest is overly literary and I didn't quite get the jokes. Even so, Wikipedia says Edmund Wilson enjoyed this playfulness immensely.On the other hand, V's investigation of Sebastian's personal life is touching and magical. Here, V's learns that Sebastian, despite his rich literary sensibility, lived a lonely and unglamorous life. But in this narrative component, V's social interactions, especially with Mr. Silbermann, are fun and wonderful and sorta like magical realism. The Nab put this in for non-professors like me.As usual with Nabokov, the writing is absolutely great. Here is one of numerous examples, with V describing the burning of Sebastian's letters, which occurs in Chapter 4. ""But as I was burning them in the grate one sheet of the blue became loose, curving backwards under the torturing flame, and before the crumpling blackness had crept over it, a few words appeared in full radiance, then swooned and all was over.""Recommended (but not easy)."

It is. It contains the subtlety and puzzling qualities and droll humor of his great works and still manages to work in its own little bit of beauty. It also has its duller stretches, it lacks a real point, and it is more than vaguely pretentious, but nothing unforgivable. As his first full-length work in English, perhaps it should be treated more as an experiment in compositional workability than anything else.The relative ease of reading this as compared to Nabokov's best, like 'Pale Fire' and 'Lolita,' may make it a good introduction to novices."

As my sister has written, it warrants another reading. There is so much to process.And this is because the novel occupies a very slippery place: fictional biography/mystery. It is one or the other or both. And Nabokov is definitely having fun with the various conventions and forms that these two genre frequently utilize.A brother loses another brother. Both brothers are writers. Both brothers in some sense are strangers. The one searches for meaning in the other&#8217;s work. We search for meaning from the other. You are thinking that this is rather confusing without my mentioning names, but I&#8217;ve arrived at a conclusion: these names are meaningless. Most of the characters in this novel are cut-outs, they&#8217;re only loosely imagined. The one brother can be interchanged with the other, and Nabokov often plays with his layering/mirroring.It is a novel about the written word and the power of story, specifically the way a story is shaped by it&#8217;s creator. We watch as V. (which stands for Victor by the way&#8212;thank you very much wikipedia) shapes the chronicle of Sebastian Knight&#8217;s life. Or is Sebastian Knight the real brother?The reader must decide which reality to believe, which brother is the subject of this story. It seems very confusing and yet Nabokov provides this meta-narrative parody in the most simple and straight-forward ways.It is as simple as a brother seeking out the various characters of the other brother&#8217;s life in an attempt to create some kind of truth. That we the reader know this is an impossibility, only makes this search that much more humorous.Nabokov frequently laughs at his readers but I&#8217;ve never felt that more strongly than here in this novel. It was as if he was looking over my shoulder and poking me in the ribs. &#8220;Huh&#8230;uh&#8230;.huh&#8230;you see that. Did you see that?!&#8221;As in many of Nabokov&#8217;s novels, not much really occurs. Tea, train-rides, conversations in a garden, and yet so much is happening behind the scenes, in between these small moments.On most book-covers for The Real Life of Sebastian Knight there is a chess-piece. The novel can and should be viewed as a kind of chess game. We see all the pieces, we see them from multiple angles, and no one is safe.My sister might have some words with me but I dare say that this novel is almost (and it&#8217;s just a fleeting thought dear sister) my favourite of Nabokov&#8217;s novels.I am not sure if I&#8217;m selling this novel properly to you, my casual blog/tumblr reader. The only way to really experience a Vladimir Nabokov novel is to pick one up and dive in. There are some things you will catch and then there are those that you will completely miss.

B0006APJFA,The real life of Sebastian Knight,,A3S03YZTFOIGOE,E. A. Farrington,0/0,5.0,1312070400,His Usual Tricks,"To place my reading of this book in context, I am an avowed Nabokov fangirl and this is my 11th of his novels and 14th of his books generally. This is not my favorite of his by any means, but I give it 5 stars because being a lesser work in the Nabokov canon is not really a condemnation. Even a run-of-the-mill Nabokov can hold its own with most novels.The elements of mystery, deception, and other literary hijinks that you encounter in this book will be much more confusing or surprising for readers new to Nabokov. If you have read other works of his before, particularly other works with similar focus on a mystery and suspense-- like ""Lolita"" or ""Despair""-- these tricks and traps will be familiar or even repetitive. That did not make them less enjoyable, but it did color my reading because (knowing Nabokov) I had worked out the mysteries of the plot before their climactic revelations. The plot twists in this sense are also much less obscure than they are in ""Lolita"" (though admittedly that was my first Nabokov and I was caught completely unawares by the ending the first time around). He hilariously mocks the detective genre, referring to plot devices that any reader of Agatha Christie will recognize immediately, but then ironically employs rather similar tricks. There are the usual Nabokovian elements of coincidence and absurdity, which culminate in the ""deathbed revelations"" and are evocative of the cruel but remarkably funny absurdities of ""Laughter in the Dark."" As Nabokov's first work in English, ""Sebastian Knight"" provides an interesting example of the development of his vision and style.As far as the themes particular to this book, the meditation on identity that occurs throughout and reaches its apex in the final pages is provocative and deeply interesting. Remain attuned as you're reading to these little jokes of identity and you will be much more appreciative of this ending. The book is on the whole wonderfully funny, significantly lighter in tone than some of his novels (which is saying something). I would recommend it in particular to those who are familiar with the genre of literary biography or detective novels, as this is quite an entertaining parody of those, or to those dedicated readers who wish to know more of Nabokov's views on the hereafter, women, and modern literature in general. But if this is the only Nabokov you will ever read, you'd do much better to choose ""Lolita,"" ""Pale Fire,"" or, if you have more time and effort to spare, ""Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle."""

The femme fatale, the quest for a brother, the mysterious stranger who helps V., V.'s apologies for his poor writing (which I suspect few could match) are all quite deliberately satirical. Anyone who reads the novel, believing everything they are told, will miss a lot. The reader should especially keep an eye out for the wonderful interaction between life and text. This is probably one of Nabokov's &quot;simpler&quot; novels in the sense that most of the tricks are visible as tricks, even if one cannot at first identify them.

His dealing with the issue of death, as in 'Ultima Thule' etc., appears also here; the last book written by Knight is, however, written about in a pale and uninspiring way (Nabokov could not make his vision clear?), and, surprisingly for Nabokov, is not free of commonplaces and dejavous. All in all the book is original and interesting, as nearly everything Nabokov wrote. And, by the way, the treatment of the relation narrator-genius (commonplace in itself, unfortunately) looks better than in Mann's Doctor Faustus, where it is taken quite heavily (one does not see the traces of the hammer blows).Side remark: the stars practice is really annoying: isn't there a way to write about books without grading them?"
B0006APJFA,The real life of Sebastian Knight,,ASOJUBRHQI1DW,IRA Ross,14/14,5.0,1122854400,"My Brother, Myself","This exquisitely written novel fills one with despair. It is a sadness that was perhaps felt by many after such rare and creative geniuses as Mozart, Van Gogh, Shubert, and Gershwin all died too young after such short careers. Some of these men, like Sebastian Knight, died in relative obscurity. Sebastian's half-brother, the narrator of this novel, enters upon a journey to uncover the last months of Sebastian's life, to discover his secret, and perhaps to find out about the shadowy woman who was supposedly his last lover.Sebastian's handful of books were admired by some of the critics, who found them scholarly and poetic, and his last novel was judged a masterpiece. Most of Sebastian's books were little read by a public who were probably more inclined to read the popular potboilers of the day. The half-brother, while loving and admiring Sebastian, barely knew him himself, only knowing that Sebastian lead a lonely, sad existence, and that he suffered from a congenital heart condition. What lends much of the novel its sadness is the palpable desperation of the narrator's quest. While his efforts in uncovering his brother's secret may have been less than successful, he did learn much about what Nabokov calls our common shared humanity with the souls of others. This is a beautifully written and heartfelt narrative that should be read by those who appreciate great literature."

B0006APJFA,The real life of Sebastian Knight,,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,Dennis Littrell,3/3,5.0,1281830400,A narrative within a narrative within a narrative,"According to the Introduction by Conrad Brenner this was written in 1938 in Paris. It was Nabokov's first book composed in English, although I understand he had translated ""Despair"" into English from his Russian in 1935. What stands out to me is the contrast between the English English of ""Sebastian Knight"" and the American English that he employed so marvelously in ""Lolita."" Only a master of language--which Nabokov is without doubt--could have written both novels. Yet, while the differences in idiom, spelling and expression are true and distinct, the intricate, precise composition of plot and the deliberate game-playing with the reader, which are hallmarks of Nabokov's unique style, are very much the same in both novels.What isn't the same is the experience for the reader. In ""Lolita"" Nabokov plays upon the reader's sense of what is right and wrong to the extent that we find ourselves in sympathy with Humbert Humbert who, objectively speaking, is a pedophile, a rapist and a child abductor. In ""Sebastian Knight"" our sympathies are confused, at least in the beginning, although in the end it is hard not to identify with Sebastian's loving half-brother who does the first person narration. What Nabokov plays with is the reader's sense of who really is narrating the story. The authorial command of the book--the authentic voice behind the telling of the events--is it really Sebastian's nearly anonymous half-brother or is he just a shill for Sebastian himself? Or is this (on another level) a story of Vladimir Nabokov himself as this brilliant writer ""Sebastian Knight"" told by Nabokov in the guise of a supposed younger, adoring half-brother?This is the trick of the novel. How Nabokov adores tricks! How he loves to fool and misguide the reader and play with the reader's sensibilities and perceptions! He does this because to Nabokov the novel is a deception, an art form like all art forms that relies on a representation of truth controlled by the artist. What is the truth of Sebastian's life? What is the truth about Nabokov's life? Was he in some sense the tortured Sebastian whose work was misunderstood and misinterpreted by the vain and stupid Mr. Goodman? Was he in some other sense Humbert Humbert whose shameful acts could only see the light of day in a novel?Nabokov has answered in the negative. He insists that his characters are puppets on his--the artist's--string. And of course we must not commit the biographical fallacy--or so I was taught many years ago in undergraduate English classes. But no artist's life is completely removed from his work. And no writer of fiction can completely divorce himself from reliance on that which he knows intimately. What is marvelous about the great writers--Tolstoy, Shakespeare, et al., and Nabokov himself--is their ability to be so many characters and in those characters to display the psychological veracity that makes the characters seem truer than true.It is interesting to know that Nabokov, after the success of ""Lolita,"" went back and translated into English the novels he wrote in Russian under the pen name V. Sirin. It is also interesting to read at the end of Chapter 18 in ""Sebastian Knight"" these words: ""And sometimes I tell myself that it would not be inordinately hard to translate ...[Sebastian's novel 'The Doubtful Asphodel'] into Russian."" Here again the narrator is at odds with himself as to his English language abilities. Before he was poor in English; now he could be a translator from English into Russian.This raises the further question, mentioned below, as to what extent we can trust the younger brother--perhaps with younger brother aspirations--on other matters. We might ask ourselves, is the narrator being fair to M. Goodman? To what extent is he objective about Sebastian? We can even ask are Sebastian's strangely named novels really all that good? The prose selected as quotes from those novels is striking yes, but so is the prose of our (unreliable?) narrator, who although he claims no expertise in the English language, gives the lie to that bit of modesty by writing (as far as this reader can tell) as well as his older half-brother. The sense we have about the authorial voice is further confused by how much both brothers sound alike. Normally this would be a fault, but because Nabokov's intent is to fuse the three authors--himself, Sebastian and the first person narrator--into one in such a way as to suggest to the reader that artifice and reality are not so easily distinguished.What I also like about this novel is the sense of Europe between the two great wars that Nabokov achieves. There are no dark clouds hanging over Europe, and there is almost no mention of the senseless war that ended some twenty years before. Nabokov and his characters care not the slightest for politics or international intrigues. There is a clear, deliberate effort at showing life entirely without war or the threat or aftermath of war. Only once does Nabokov acknowledge that there is a political world beyond the day-to-day concerns of his characters. Near the end of the book as his hero is rushing madly to get to Sebastian before he dies, he asks in passing, ""Who were those idle idiots who wrote on the wall, 'Death to the Jews'?...""Few writers can use coincidence to surprise and delight the reader the way Nabokov can. One recalls Charlotte Haze conveniently killing herself off at exactly the right time by running out in front of an automobile. In Sebastian Knight we have the narrator conveniently meet on a train a man, who for unknown reasons comes to the narrator's aid and helps him find the identity of a mysterious woman that Sebastian loved and lost.Finally I have to say that for many readers this novel will develop too slowly and too obscurely to be readily appreciated. But stay with it. It builds to a kind of intriguing lucidity and even develops into a dramatic narrative toward the end.[Note: Nearly a hundred of my fiction reviews by great literary artists and others not so well known are now available in my book, ""Novels and other Fictions.""

Reader,3/3,3.0,1188777600,Consistently entertaining,"Once I had closely re-read the first 10-20 pages to better absorb the personal histories, which I found confusing at first read, I was well-fortified to enjoy the rest of the book. The writing is fabulous and I liked the mystery motif. There were very few slow spots and plenty of humor and seeming insight, yet the book had only a superficial effect on me. I left not really feeling I understood Sebastian or his half-brother (Knight's biographical researcher) very well at all -- and not particularly caring either, because it was so pleasant to read and I'm not sure that it was the author's intention to make us really care about the characters. While there is deep philosophy discussed, the book had a lightweight feel. Maybe that was the intent of the book -- to make the point that people (the half-brother biographer and the famous brother) are ultimately indescribable no matter how much you describe them and their acts. Or maybe it was just a display of great writing that was intended to transcend the content, a virtuoso display. In a certain way it reminded me of the previous book I read, This Side of Paradise by F.Scott Fitzgerald, in that each is the story about a purportedly brilliant young author (Fitzgerald himself, and the fictional Sebastian Knight). But Fitzgerald's book, while sophomoric and at times silly in the beginning, ultimately became quite serious and almost sublime -- plus we know what actually happened to talented Fitzgerald, adding another layer of poignancy. Nabokov's book also reminded me of some of the Nouveau Roman authors of the 1950's-1960's where all of the detail is just an intellectual game, not intended for serious reader involvement. Nevertheless, I will definitely read more of Nabokov. This was I believe his first book in English and I figured I would start there."

The title caught my attention so I checked it out, and I am so glad I did! This book is very unlike any other relationship book I have read thus far, (from the Christian perspective anyhow, some of Dr. Crabb's sentiments about gender differences are echoed by Dr. Laura, John Gray, and others). His approach to explaining differences is both humble and enticing. For women who struggle to overcome a very feminist background in which the term ""submission"" causes the hair on our neck to rise, his book is palpable and invites one to examine his or her motives.Dr. Crabb's explanations are such that your mind and heart remain open to receiving something profound. This book is beneficial not just for individuals struggling in relationships, but singles as well, the premise being one that reminds us that our main enemy in life is selfishness and the only freedom from a life lived in a self-centered prison is one which focuses on other-centered living: how true, and how simple. As the Word says, ""the truth will set you free,"" indeed, the truth as it is presented in this book, if humbly embraced, has the capacity to do just that."

L Teuling ""meloroze""",3/3,3.0,1250812800,"I may be out of step here, -- but here goes!","For the most part, Dr. Crabb has aimed his book at Christian couples. And several things I can wholeheartedly agree with:1. A lot of marital unhappiness can come from being too self-centered and not other-centered enough.2. A person's needs for security and significance are ultimately met in his or her personal relationship to God through Jesus Christ, and this is the most important part of life to nurture and build.Beyond that, though, I have a problem with a basic idea in Dr. Crabb's thinking. He asserts that a man's main need is ""significance"" and a woman's main need is ""security."" And I think that he makes this into too much of a system. While he will say that men need security and women need significance, I think he arbitrarily names men's desires ""significance"" and a woman's desires ""security"" when they may not be. I've always been leery of stereotyping people.Now I must admit that as a woman I like security -- especially financial! And I like the ""security"" of being loved by my husband. But I still want to make some accomplishments in life apart from who I'm married to. I'm a writer, musician and teacher, and those make up as much of my life as my domestic side, and recognition in these areas will probably be more important to my SIGNIFICANCE desire than my SECURITY desire -- unless, of course, I receive a large cash award and that will make me feel more SECURE! (Hmmm -- maybe that will bolster Dr. Crabb's theory a bit more.)Take the good that you can out of this book -- and there's a lot of it. But I would say to both men and women: don't let anyone stereotype you because of your gender."

He supports his points by scriptural reference, by referring to his counseling, and to common sense.If you don't like his goal, if you have the modern view of such things, this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire, he is, above all, plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree, even vehemently disagree, with his views, it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book, whatever your position, with reason, logic, and fact, and you will know more about, among other things, what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels, but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that, if men and women are to take gender-separate roles, the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace, or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work, or a supervisor. Then what?As I say, worth reading if it doesn't change your mind in the slightest, or if it does."

He finds out that it really is an egg, a dragon egg, when it hatches and out comes a dragon. He names her Saphira. Over time the dragon grows, bigger and bigger.

While following the Ra'zac's tracks, he trains both physically and magically. Soon Eragon's battle turns into an all out war against the king and the empire. Friendships are made, and alliances are tested, as the only ones who can help, Eragon and Saphira, are clueless as to how. They soon learn that the Varden, a group of humans and dwarfs will be able to help them. But to get there they must cross a huge desert. Will they survive while crossing it?I liked this book for many reasons. One, my copy of the book had a map, so I could follow Eragon's trail. There were also some Czech based words, which in the book was used as the ""ancient Language"" that summoned magic, but there was a huge glossary in the back that you could check.

The book pulls you in from the very first paragraph of the prologue, when we are introduced to a character called a Shade (can't wait to see him in the movie) who is chasing after an elf in possession of some sort of precious stone. The meaning and purpose of the stone can be found within the amazing 497 pages of this book. The characters are great and you find yourself either rooting for them, crying for them, or hating them (in a good way). The best part about this book is that it is only the first of a trilogy, and its author is only 21 years old, so there is much more to come from Paolini.

Also, I did find myself wanting more interaction with the boy and the dragon, they are the main characters, and yet for most of the first half of the book they don't even talk to each other much, let alone enteract with each other. All in all I thought it was a good book."

This is Christopher Paolini, who was fifteen when he wrote this story, first book. Also, Eragon is the first book in the trilogy, which is a lot like Terry Brooks' Shannara collection. In both, there are mystic elves, stout dwarves, mighty dragons, and powerful magic.Eragon, a youthful farm boy, while hunting in a dangerous mountain range, stumbles across a wonderful blue rock. Thinking to sell or trade it to help his family through the harsh, northern winter, Eragon keeps the stone. Before he gets the chance to sell it, it hatches something thought to be extinct... a sapphire-blue dragon! Eragon develops a mental connection with the dragon, and when the murdering Ra'zac kill his uncle, he leaves his village only to find out that he is the first of the new generation of Dragon Riders. The Dragon Riders were the peacekeepers of Alagaesia Eragon is fated to be the one to turn the tide of the coming war to overthrow the cruel king, Galbatorix. Eragon and Saphira, his dragon, set out to find their way through the darkness, constantly growing in strength and knowledge.Though this novel is exceptionally interesting, it is sometimes hard to understand, but Christopher Paolini has already taken care of that. There are maps, glossaries, and definitions within the book to help you along the way. Eragon is definitely for fantasy readers, ages twelve and up. Be sure to have the sequel, Eldest, close at hand, because you won't be able to wait by the end of Eragon."

However, there are some major issues that need to be addressed when giving this book an point-by-point review.1. Paolini seems to have read the same fiction I have, most significantly the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. Much of Paolini's begining plot was lifted almost directly from this epic; Boy of important but undisclosed heratage (an orphan) brought from far away to a simple village where he was raised by someone who is harmed because of his connection to him, must flee along with mysterious magic user/mentor/trainer etc. Many of the names are echoed as well, ""Therinsford"" in Eragon from the name of a main character in Wheel of Time (Lews Therin, anyone?) and creatures are duplicated from other works (e.g. Jordan's trollocs play a central role in the final bit of Paolini's book) etc. Names and words echo those in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Paolini does not distance himself far enough from these base works of fantasy fiction.2. Language. Paolini did not revise his book extensively enough--you can watch his skill with dialog grow as the book progresses; he should have gone back and fixed the awkward phraseology in the introductory chapters.In summation, this was a good attempt, but further effort must be made to distance future works from the craftmanship of other authors."

In this novel, we may have her clearest portrayal of writer as freedom fighter, fighting to expose the hidden sources of anit-American journalists. There is her usual element of romance, as well as the gifted amateurs who take on the trained operatives, and win.

But ... don't start with NEITHER FIVE NOR THREE. It is one of her least appealing works.The problem is that none of the characters are especially sympathetic, even the central hero. She goes about as deeply into the minds of the bad guys as she does in any of her books, and it leaves you with a fairly bad taste in your mouth.Furthermore, the trademark romance plot is kind of stifled. The two characters who would, in most MacInnes novels, have fallen in love are actually former young lovers who have been separated by WW2. Now the woman is engaged to someone else, and the whole thing is more awkward than romantic.Also, the setting is before the cold war was openly being fought, so the battle lines are not as clear as they are in her other novels. After four WW2 spy novels, and then two non-spy romantic novels, this was her first attempt at a cold war story.This isn't a bad novel, but it is far from MacInnes at her best."

You can relate to them, feel the atmosphere of those cold war years.

He was especially known for advocating ""the highest degree of scientific rigour in the design of psychological experiments and [being] very critical of much loose thinking current at present under the guise of `psychology' (from the cover).In the course of his career he produced several pioneering books demystifying psychology for the general public: in particular a seminal trilogy (later expanded to a quartet) for Penguin, He was an exceptionally lucid and entertaining writer, and the books sold millions of copies and were translated into several other languages. The quartet comprises:Uses and Abuses of Psychology(1953)Sense and Nonsense in Psychology(1957)Fact and Fiction in Psychology(1965)Psychology is about People(1977)Interestingly, in the light of what was to come later, the author was already being described (in an Editorial Foreword) as ""controversial""; and in his own introduction, he not only accepts this appellation but embraces it:""...indeed the writer has become so used to this term that he feels almost a sense of deprivation when the chairman at a meeting, in introducing him, forgets to use [it].""But he goes on:""However, the word `controversial' has two meanings, and it is important to discriminate between them. You may say that an issue is controversial because people are in fact arguing about it, and are having a controversy. In this sense, the flatness or rotundity of the earth is controversial; there are still flat-earthers [...] From their point of view, therefore , we might say that the shape of the earth is still a controversial matter. However, from the scientific point of view, I don't think one would agree that this is so [...] [T]here is no controversy on this point, and therefore it is not `controversial' any longer.""To say this is not to say the some of the points made in this book are not controversial...""Indeed. Among the chapters that made this book famous is one entitled ""Little Hans or Little Albert?"" containing perhaps the most comprehensive and damning review of Freudian theory and practice yet published in a popular work. It cites (inter alia) the studies of Wolpe & Rachman, which use Freud's own data to show that his claims were completely inconsistent with the facts. This is followed by ""New Ways of Curing Neurosis"", documenting the successes of Behaviour Therapy (of which Eysenck was a pioneer in the UK) and contrasting its results with those of psychoanalysis. ""Therapy or Brainwashing"" then confronts head-on the criticisms being made of the methods described in the previous chapter. Of particular interest, in view the way both mores and the law have changed since the time of writing, are two pages (194-195) devoted to the morality of so-called `treatment' of homosexuality, which was of course illegal in Britain at that time. (Lesbianism, however, was legal - reportedly because Queen Victoria refused to believe it existed.)Other chapters describe a psychological laboratory, contrasting it with the analyst's couch of the popular perception; a model for the physiological mechanism behind introversion and extraversion, introduced by a hypothetical `Eysenck's Demon' along the lines of Maxwell's Demon in Physics; and an explanation of crime and conscience in terms of conditioning.This last, in addition to being thought-provoking in itself, raises some thorny ethical issues about `fairness': for instance, it is well established that extraverts respond differently to rewards and punishments than introverts. If a particular legal penalty (e.g. a fine or prison sentence) is appropriate to deter an introvert, it may well not deter an extravert - still less a psychopath. But should we then design all legal penalties for psychopaths?A broad-ranging, closely-argued and fascinating book."

Part Two is entitled covering personality tests, conditioning, the psychology of politics and the psychology of aesthetics.I found the chapter on hypnosis and suggestibility the most interesting in the book. It provides a historical survey of the subject along with a detailed discussion of the phenomena covering special subjects such as ""Who is more susceptible to hypnosis?"" Eysenck is a strict scientific empiricist so it came as some surprise to me that the subject of ESP is treated favorably leaving the reader with the informed opinion the there may certainly be something real in the belief. I found the chapter on aesthetics interesting but the least convincing that psychology had something to say on the subject. I am afraid the experiments reported seemed very simplistic, underestimating what we would call 'beautiful' when we look at a complex painting."

This, however, is not a book that I needed. It gives you some background in OO modeling that I did not like and actually did not need at all. I also suspect that somebody without previous OO knowledge might be confused. For example, on page 41, Properties, it is written: &quot;A property is a value used to denote a characteristic of a class; it can be thought of as a pair of functions, one to set the property value and one to return the property value.&quot; Property access methods are confused with a property itself !XML part is very short and general so I still have to go somewhere else to figure out how to implement XML part.

B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,AA0RC4T9DKWQS,Robert Meyers Jr.,10/10,4.0,977270400,Lew Archer in his prime,"In some ways The Doomsters is a typical Lew Archer thriller: it involves a missing suspected murderer, family strife, and mysterious deaths in the distant past. This time, Archer falls in love and self-interest actually hinders him from being the moral center of the novel. What keeps the pace of the novel flowing is the theme of a man condemned by society and Archer's efforts to prove his innocence. There is also plenty of bloodshed, betrayals, and enough plot twists to keep the conclusion a surprise. In spite of the tragic turn the story takes there is the redemption for Archer who makes up for his own dreadful mistake in the past. It explains a great deal about Archer, his motivation and his maturity which grows in later Ross Macdonald novels."

Its lyrical prose should be considered the epitome of character development and imagery. This is probably the definitive Archer book and readers learn more about Lew and what makes him the man he becomes in later novels.The novel opens with a pounding on the door at the crack of dawn--and takes off from there. An escapee from a mental institution, clad in ""the kind of clothes they give you to wear in prison"" has landed on Archer's doorstep on the advice of a fellow escapee, Tom Rica, whom Lew had helped years earlier. Carl Hallman wants Lew to investigate the death of his father, a powerful Senator from California. Carl is sure that the attending physician, Dr. Grantland, killed him, but he needs Lew's help to prove it.Never one to turn down a chance to be nosey, Lew drives Carl to the family estate in the little town of Purissima. There resides Carl's brother Jerry and Jerry's wife Zinnie. Met by a deputy sheriff, Carl runs away from Lew and becomes the subject of an intense manhunt. More bodies start popping up, specifically Jerry's. Then Lew learns that there are some unanswered questions about Carl's wife Mildred, the Senator's death, and the even death of Carl's mother three years before.Lew has a knack for uncovering buried secrets, and those secrets rise to the top in The Doomsters. Striking, unconventional PI prose and the ability to layer story lines make Ross MacDonald one of the greatest crime writers of the twentieth century.Armchair Interviews agrees."
B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,Bomojaz,4/4,5.0,1152489600,Delving into his own past,"Most detectives in fiction are stoic people who never seem to have a past of their own, at least not one that ever gets talked about much. In this novel, Ross MacDonald changes all that. His ace private eye Lew Archer is not only delving into the pasts of the characters he's investigating, trying to get to the bottom of a murder, but before it's all over he's forced to face his own past as well. Tom Rica, a heroin addict he had tried to help a few years earlier and then dismissed when his help wasn't working, reappears in his life and tells Archer that the murder of Alicia Hallman was not committed by her daughter-in-law Mildred, but by Dr. Grantland - something Rica had tried to tell him years ago, but Archer wouldn't listen. Lew Archer doesn't track down bad guys from the point of view of a removed third party - he becomes one of them. In his own way, he contributed to the death of Hallman. Guilt is an important element in the story, some of it misapplied, and Archer is forced to share in it. It's a brilliant concept, and MacDonald develops it well. This, I believe, is the first Archer novel that deserves the appellation ""masterpiece."""
B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,AFQQFCZJHLFKU,P. Mccaffrey,2/2,5.0,1306713600,A great novel,"Ross Macdonald is a greatly underrated writer and this is a greatly underrated book. Of all his books this one is my favorite. MacDonald had a Ph.D in English and it shows in the way he pulls off an amazing technical feat. The book takes place in real time except for the last few pages when he switches to a flashback and then a flashback within the flashback. The effect is amazing and the writing is sad, poignant and incredibly moving, as Archer catalogs his regrets. It also contains one of my favorite lines, when Archer says that an emotion ""Fell through me like a feather in a vacuum."" It's a shame that the book has been ghettoized as ""genre fiction"" as I believe that you rarely see great writing like this anywhere these days."
B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,A33F7392VIWMQ,henry,1/1,3.0,1322697600,Far From His Best,"I am a long time fan of Ross Macdonald, and especially the Lew Archer stories. I have read all the novels at least twice. I agree with the idea that these are ""the best series of mystery novels ever written by an American,"" and I would even drop the word ""mystery"" from that. They transcend the mystery genre into real literature.The early novels have the flavor of a 1940s pulp fiction hard-boiled detective yarn. But Ross Macdonald matured out of that and came into his own by the mid 1950s. The novels became more serious somehow, without being dry or preachy. Quite the contrary.All that said, I must say that this one, the Doomsters, is probably my least favorite of all the serious novels. There are too many murders. It tries too hard to be deep and reflective. It is too talky. Unlike the others, it is not a ""page turner.""I certainly would not want someone to start the series with the Doomsters. What then? I suggest the Zebra Striped Hearse. Then maybe the Dalton Case, eventually leading up to the really superb ones, like Sleeping Beauty."

This is the first Archer novel I recall reading, and it is a good one. The characters are each well fleshed out, and while the story ends with a couple of them facing rough challenges, there remains some hope.It starts with a man's leaving a mental hospital and hiring Archer to find out who murdered his father. The man appears paranoid, accusing his brother and sister-in-law and a local doctor of railroading him into the mental hospital and being implicated in his father's murder. A somewhat dubious Archer follows up on the case, although he's been assaulted by his client. Murder occurs, apparantly by his client, and Archer pursues a convoluted trail, untangling some of the knots in the stories he's told. The alert reader will spot the true killer, but might miss many of the details. Nevertheless, it's a satisfying read."
B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,A13O359A2KX7YY,"Michael G. ""mikefromrochester""",3/4,4.0,1115337600,A top-notch Lew Archer mystery.,"The Doomsters starts off with private eye Lew Archer being paid an early morning visit by an escaped mental patient named Carl Hallman. Archer notices that Carl is deeply troubled and confused yet surprisingly well spoken. It appears that Carl's father, a very prosperous former state senator died 6 months earlier. The death certificate says it was a heart attack. But Carl has his doubts.As Archer is drawn into the case, he gets to meet the members of Carl's very dysfunctional family. There's his beautiful, long suffering wife, Mildred. His not so brotherly brother, Jerry. And his seductive sister-in-law, Zinnie. Rounding out the cast of characters are a shady MD and a pot-bellied sheriff for whom Archer takes an immediate dislike.The Doomsters is a skillfully told story of greed and betrayal. Carl Hallman is a victim. That much is clear from the very first chapter. But the full extent of his victimization only comes out at the book's surprising conclusion.With great dialogue, vividly descriptive prose and a fast paced narrative that unfolds smoothly, this novel is a real treat. Do yourself a favor and read it."
B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,A18DH7N6ZI48L4,Badman,0/0,3.0,1347148800,"Doomsters is average detective story, not Archer's best","The Doomsters has one of the best beginnings of any Archer book, as the private eye is awakened by an escaped mental patient that was recommended to Archer by a former friend; Archer has to drive the man to his ancestral home, and much happens on the way there and after Archer arrives (including of course murder). Archer finds all sorts of bad things going on in this family, both past and present, and the ""doomsters"" keep picking off family members one by one until Archer can find out what is going on.Some of MacDonald's best subject matter (dysfunctional families, insanity and mental illness, drug abuse), and many murders, but strangely not one of the more compelling Archer mysteries. The novel is too talky, and too serious in tone as if MacDonald is writing the story as a public service against families that treat their children badly. Also, Archer does little here except for run around and find bodies and except for discovering the identity of the murderer at the end really doesn't help out much (things would have proceeded pretty much as written whether or not Archer was present in most cases).While not one of MacDonald's best (I'd rate it in the lower third of all Archer mysteries) it does have a somewhat unexpected denouement although all the clues are there for the reader to find. The cast is not very interesting IMO despite their eccentricities, but the book picks up 2/3 of the way through and has some interesting revelations at the end. Still does not rise to the high standard of the earlier stories like The Ivory Grin nor the later classics like The Chill."
B0006AVERW,The doomsters,,A14G4O1XFYP9IN,"Booker G ""ultimate reader""",0/0,4.0,1337126400,This book fits its title perfectly,"Ross Macdonald has a way with plots and words that keeps me coming back to his Lew Archer's series even though every book presents a very gloomy view of human nature. In ""The Doomsters"" there is an unrelenting grimness to the plot and character interactions that befits the title, which comes from a Thomas Hardy poem ""To an Unborn Pauper's Child."" In the poem the doomsters are evil forces lurking in the background to bring down misfortune on people.In this book Macdonald once again focuses on dysfunctional families as a major cause of murder and other evil deeds. Archer gets involved with a very messed up wealthy family and also a poor woman and her alcoholic mother. His involvement begins when one of the sons in the rich family escapes from a mental hospital and looks up Archer for help, based on the advice of his fellow escapee who has a history with Archer. Archer finds himself drawn into helping the young man, i.e., his usual messianic urge asserts itself.Greed is another typical theme for Macdonald, and when greed is coupled with dysfunctional family situations in ""The Doomsters"" murders proliferate. It is distressing to this reader to watch the violence unfold, along with fraud, blackmail, and other crimes.In this book we learn more about Archer than in any other up to this point in the series. The reader learns how his divorce from his wife Sue affected him at the time it was taking place. We also learn how he let down a young man he was trying to mentor at that same time and the ramifications of his behavior toward the young man. Archer seems to reach new personal convictions about the shades of gray in human behavior after this case. He no longer believes all it takes to make life better is to find the evil people and lock them up--he knows there is potential evil in all of us."

MacDonald writes so well about the weakness's of humans, his writing is much more than hard boiled detective fiction.There is some Archer back story in this story that I haven't encountered in the other novels in the series that I have read.This story is not as good as ""The Chill"" but then again nothing is, but it's a good murder mystery and a fine way to spend a Sunday on the couch."

Far too often the authors make false distinctions between a supposed ""old"" Church that existed before Vatican II and a ""new and improved"" Church that exists now. For instance, they describe worshippers before the council as ""not participants as much as watchers, separated by distance, architecture, and language."" Nowhere in the documents of Vatican II or in authoritative pronouncements from the Magisterium will you find such a sweeping, negative assessment.The authors also claim that Vatican II removed Latin from the liturgy, when in reality the Council fathers instructed that ""[t]he use of the Latin language is to be preserved ..."" (albeit with an allowance that some of the vernacular may be incorporated.) Likewise, Vatican II had nothing to do with communion in the hand, an innovation introduced in the United States and other Western countries years later; the authors list it as an achievement of the Council. A frequent theme of this book on liturgical matters is disruption instead of continuity.In the chapter on the Bible, the authors operate from the presumption readers believe the Gospels were written soon after Jesus' death and Resurrection. To the extent teens have thought about this question at all, it's more likely that they believe the more pervasive false notion that the Gospels were written hundreds of years later. (See Dan Brown's ""Da Vinci Code."")Perhaps one day someone will take the recently-releasedUnited States Catholic Catechism for Adultsand adapt it for teens. In the meantime, this book is a flawed substitute. Excellent resources currently available areFather McBride's Teen Catechism, the multi-volumeDidache seriesproduced by the Midwest Theological Forum, and theProve It!series written by Amy Welborn."

And the popular attitude toward it and how it changed from a land of drought and death to the tourist lands of today.The Old Spanish Trail wended its way to California through the Sonoran Desert to the south, but Spanish settlement never got further north than the Tucson area. Far to the north both the Oregon Trail and the Santa Fe trail started in Missouri and crossed the formidable Great Plains; the latter in the days after the Louisiana Purchase passed into Nuevo Mexico from Colorado.Except for the raiding Comanches of the Grat Plains and further west, the mighty Navajo nation, there was little Indian settlement to bar western travel; the tribes along the Gila and in southern California were not a horse culture and were known as digger Indians for the primitive sticks they used to plant corn.After the railroads met at Ogden, Utah, safe cross travel across the Great Basin was finally possible, and the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific went through to the south.Except for the Mormons and their far flung State of Deseret, there was litle traffic except catty-corner to San Diego.The major emphasis was not on setllement until the fabulously rich mining cities, such as Virginia City, led to development from the Sierra Nevada side. Entry from the SE was blocked by the Rio Grande box, the Grand Canyon, and the scenic canyon lands. And Death Valley is still as isolated as it ever was away fro the railway.After the mining settled down, the Santa Fe built a branch line to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and a hotel; the Union Pacific through Ogden began to run tourist trains and built resorts.In the mid 19th century there were several major scientific mapping expeditions covering portions of the area at 1;250,000 scale (approximately 1/4 inch to a mile). The responsibility for mapping the Trans Pecos was regularized by the establishment of the United States Geological Survey in the 1870s. As mechanized mining has developed, the vast hordes of hard rock miners have long since moved on and the population of the California-Nevada area has depleted in favor of resorts like Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas.The Four Corners area has the huge coal burning Navajo power plant supplying Arizona and southrn Calfornia. So as long as the power holds out and air conditioning is availabl parts of the Basin will thrive. And tourist will come to view the deserts.Sixty years plus ago John ford filmed many epics in Monument Valley. Arizona and new Mexico have active film commissions so the public perception is changing once more.One modern problem is the fractured land management; the transcontinental railroads were paid with every alternate section of land north and south of their route. The US Forest Service, the National Park Service,combined with the Bureau of Land Management holdings, put most of Nevada and Utah under federal control, so there is little private land left.The entire Great Basin includes most of western Utah, most of Nevada, NW Arizona and southern Idaho and chunks of the surrounding states so that there are few maps of any useful scale showing the whole province.The various geologic maps are good examples of the ""State Line Faults"" so notorious among earth scientists. This occurs, when mapping geology, the surveys began in the interior and spread out to the state lines, where the stratigraphy seldom matches. Today USGS is producing uniform coverage of the whole US.Nowadays one flies transcontinentally either through Albuquerque or Denver, and the Great Basin is known as ""redeye"" or ""flyover country""."

I speak about it at museums, universities, and conferences. I write about videoblogging. I produce my own videoblog. I run a program where we teach dozens of teens to videoblog.

There are a large number of exercises included, and the later ones in a section are usually quite challenging and enlightening; many of them extend the main text substantially without increasing the length of the exposition.

I would then give them 5 additional words from any earlier chapter to keep them reviewing. These books are great. My students (from 6th-11th grade) all love them.

0875580904,Gandhi As a Political Strategist: With Essays on Ethics and Politics (Extending horizons books),,A229PUDZSX182Q,sasha_,14/14,3.0,1073865600,...,"I read this book after reading Sharp's series &quot;The Politics of Nonviolent Action&quot;, a masterpiece of originality, clarity and thoroughness. And I've been quite interested in Gandhi and his philosophy for years. So I was really disappointed in this book, which seems to be a half-hearted collection of Sharp's essays on Gandhi--and some that aren't even on Gandhi. (Hence the subtitle, &quot;with essays on ethics and politics&quot;.) Nonetheless, the book is hard to find, so I'll wrote the table of contents here.ContentsIntroduction by Coretta KingPART ONE: GANDHI AS A POLITICAL STRATEGIST1. Gandhi's Political Significance2. Origins of Gandhi's Use of Nonviolent Struggle: A Review-Essay on Erik Erikson's &quot;Gandhi's Truth&quot;3. Gandhi on the Thoery of Voluntary Servitude4. Satyagraha and Political Conflict: A Review of Joan V. Bondurant's &quot;Conquest of Violence&quot;5. The Theory of Gandhi's Constructive Program6. Gandhi's Evaluation of Indian Nonviolent Action7. India's Lesson for the Peace Movement8. Gandhi's Defense Policy9. Gandhi as a National Defense StrategistPART TWO: ESSAYS ON ETHICS AND POLITICS10. Type of Principles Nonviolence11. Ethics and Responsibility in Politics: A Critique of the Present Adequacy of Max Weber's Classification of Ethical Systems12. Morality, Politics, and Political Technique13. Nonviolence: Moral Principle or Political Technique? Clues from Gandhi's Thought and ExperienceAPPENDICESA. Shridharani's Contribution to the Study of Gandhi's TechniqueB. The War in 1942C. Glossary of Indian TermsD. Sources for Further StudyE. Recommendations for Course UsageF. Suggestions for Preparing Courses on Gandhi...and that's about it.Sharp has some great points here. One of the best is that, while Gandhi is often thought to have judged his movement a failure towards the end of his life, this isn't the whole story; Gandhi published an enormous amount, writing constantly for various newspapers and talking to many reporters, and while he judged his movement a failure on some days on other days he judged it a success; one should really look at an analysis of the movement itself, not Gandhi's changing evaluations. He also talks about Gandhi's thoughts on a potential nonviolent defense strategy, which was simply inadequate and not thought through very well. This is something that is often neglected in studies of Gandhi's thought. Also, his chapter on categories of nonviolence may be useful for some.The most annoying thing about this book is that many of the chapters are atrociously redundant. 8 and 9 in particular, as well as 11 and 12. The writing is already a little bit dry, and two chapters which both say the exact same thing, one a little worse than the other, doesn't help at all. Sharp should have put in a few more hours of work and combined them. Also, some essays, such as the third chapter, are largely quotes of Gandhi with little added.Finally, I'd say that this book is only for those who are excessively interested in Gandhi. But I would repeat that Sharp's Series on &quot;The Politics of Nonviolent Action&quot; is, unlike this uninspired collection, magnificent."

While I can appreciate how well and acurately she portrays day to day life, human nature, and the observational lifestyle of writers, in the end I can't help but be wishing that more had HAPPENED in this novel. In the first half of the book nothing seems to happen at all, and then all the events set up in the second half seem to have no resolution of any kind. I understand that real life is also without specific beginnings and endings, but I can't help but wish for a little structure in fiction.

Shields's prose is tight and flows on humor, descriptive genius and observations that qualify as wisdom for any age. Lots goes on in this somewhat messy, subversive house: biographer and frustrated novelist Judith spins a tale of rude surprises, unexpected joys and everyday living over a 12 month period, laced with the anxious stuff of families. Husband Martin,academic and expert on ""Paradise Lost""; teenage daughter Meredith, like her mother a ""repository of innocence and knowledge""; and son Richard, 12 and ""sour with love."" The Gills in Shields's hands are enough to keep the novel charged, but visitors add to the flow: fellow-authors, academics, best friends, family and in-laws. Judith considers herself a prying spy; she ferrets for nuggets of enlightenment from those around her,and the results are wry and wise comments on life's long list of ironies. Shield's narrative entertains and delights with the ease of a life-long runner out for a jog; she lets her characters get lost in living, to enjoy the hilly and strenuous course. At the end of Small Ceremonies, after being enchanted by a maturing Judith and her eye for people and her faith in them, I knew more about life than when I began. Shields is an accessible author, somewhat quirky and without airs, a Canadian who keeps pace with Margaret Atwood and Alice Munro by being this person you'd really would have liked to have met."

0793148278,Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage,,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,Robert Morris,2/2,5.0,1017273600,The Global Cookie Jar,"Occasionally, an author's concluding remarks shed a great deal of light on what that author's purposes are. That is certainly true of this book. Consider this brief excerpt from the Afterword in which Fink observes: ""Acts of terror [e.g. such as those which occurred on September 11th] notwithstanding, economic espionage remains one of the most serious threats to our national security since the Cold War. Therefore, we ought to have seasoned generals leading, and weathered soldiers fighting, the good battles that need to be fought."" However, with all due respect to the F.B.I. and to legislation such as the Economic Espionage Act [EEA], ""...you still need to be your own best defense against espionage with proper internal education, training, and procedures"" and under no circumstances ""delegate the crisis management work for your company to the government. It is too important."" This brief excerpt helps to explain why this book can be so valuable to decision-makers in global organizations.Recent research studies have dentified issues of greatest concern to senior-level executives, following September 11th. The top five are mail processing (86%), travel (85%), protection of employees (79%), protection of infrastructure (75%), and risk assessment (71%). Obviously, there is widespread and quite legitimate concern about protecting human beings and physical property. However, as Fink eloquently explains, we must also be concerned about -- and take appropriate measures to protect -- information which is as important to the global economy as oxygen is to the human body.As events on September 11th clearly indicate, even a country with resources such as those possessed by the United States cannot totally defend itself and its people against terrorists acts. However, because the U.S.A. remains the world leader in research, development, new technology, products, and trade secrets, organizations within the U.S.A. are high-profile targets and ""economic espionage spies are still going to come after [them] and that only increases [the] global risk of economic espionage."" As previously indicated, Fink's book examines the nature and extent of that potential risk, suggesting all manner of strategies and tactics to anticipate and then prepare for, as well as respond to, economic espionage because it is ""a business crisis and should be treated as such.""Fink asserts that ""Companies are under attack and at enormous risk every day. from the global threat of economic espionage, but the risk can and should be lowered and managed. Here's how."" He organizes his material within two Sections and presents it in 29 interrelated chapters, followed by an Afterword in which he addresses the question, ""EEA: Bear Trap or Mouse Trap?"" To explain ""here's how"", he uses the largest economic espionage case ever tried in the United States -- Avery Dennison/Four Pillars -- from his vantage point as the lead crisis management expert for Avery Dennison. Fink guides his reader step-by-step through that seminal case, also also citing along the way relevant situations in other companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gillette, Kodak, Lucent Technologies, and MasterCard.Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Obviously decision-makers in global organizations. Also service providers to those organizations (e.g. attorneys, accountants, insurance underwriters, management consultants) as well as officials in governmental agencies who are directly or indirectly involved in economic espionage threats as well as acts. I also highly recommend Fink's previous book, Crisis Management, first published in 1986 but more relevant today than ever before. America is at greatest risk because it has the most worth stealing. Those with ""sticky fingers"" know that and so must those whose task it is to deny them."

The book has been thoroughly researched and well documented with a couple of hundred source notes to back it up, including interviews with former and current Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents, as well as many corporate executives. In addition, the author cites no less than three Avery Dennison attorneys who reviewed the manuscript for accuracy. People who plunk down good money for good books appreciate this kind of substantive research. Curiously, in the face of this rock-solid reporting there emerges a childishly cranky ""reviewer"" from Avery Dennison's Pasadena hometown. (Hmmm?) His - or her - bias seems simplistic and obvious. Having followed this particular case and the Avery Dennison company closely for many years, I have come across quite a few embarrassing incidents that the author might have included had he wanted - perhaps some discomfiting snafus involving the company's lawyers missing scheduled court dates, or company lawyers being publicly rebuked by the trial judge for having loose lips, or gaffes by self-doubting senior management and hyper-nervous internal PR flaks. Even though those incidents may have little to do with the important topic of Economic Espionage, it still might be interesting, if not amusing, if they became public one day. This could be a slippery slope for transparent individuals with personal agendas.Like the author's previous book on crisis management, ""Sticky Fingers"" is a book that belongs on every business bookshelf. Company executives and managers would be wise to read it and learn how to prevent the theft of their valuable trade secrets...before they wind up as victimized as the hapless Avery Dennison."

After reading Sticky Fingers, I am much more cautious about the information I share outside the company, whether I'm at a tradeshow or in the elevator.

Steven Fink splits the difference and solves your problem with this book that is half spy story, half business advice. Sticky Fingers works best as a thriller. As business advice, the book highlights the basic issues for U.S. companies fighting economic espionage, but falls short of serving up a complete playbook. The devil, as always, is in the details, and the specifics of the book&#65533;s real-life cases sketch a more accurate picture of this particular devil than the generalized advice. If economic espionage is the elephant in the corner that your company has been pretending does not exist, we from getAbstract recommend Sticky Fingers as a starting point to finally taking action to protect yourself."

Using actual real world examples involving Avery Dennison / Four Pillars, Lucent Technologies, and Eastman Kodak, Fink has crafted a practical and easy-to-read book on how companies should protect their most valuable corporate asset - their trade secrets.In the case involving Avery Dennison (the label and adhesives maker), Fink provides a detailed look at what caused a highly respected scientist at Avery Dennison to sell his company's trade secrets to a foreign competitor, namely Four Pillars of Taiwan. The ensuing court trial makes for interesting reading.Using the example of Eastman Kodak and one of its former employees, Fink again discusses the motivation behind selling one's former employers' trade secrets for personal gain. This human element, which Fink writes about with great ease and clarity, is often overlooked in other books on economic and industrial espionage.The chapter on the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and the types of information worth protecting should be 'must reads' for every business manager. I would like to have seen another chapter on methods that companies can use to protect their trade secrets.All in all, a solid book that provides useful information in an easy to read format.Mark Robinson, author of ""Beyond Competitive Intelligence: The Practice of CounterIntelligence and Trade Secrets Protection."""

I have followed Fink's work since the publication in the mid-1980's of his first (terrific) business book, CRISIS MANAGEMENT: PLANNING FOR THE INEVITABLE. In this newest work, Fink once again uses his engaging and lively writing style (he is also a novelist) to alert readers to America's newest and biggest business crisis -- the theft of trade secrets. Filled with fascinating case studies of companies that have been &quot;ripped off&quot; and victimized by insiders, disgruntled employees, unscrupulous competitors and even &quot;friendly&quot; foreign governments (such as Japan), the book offers straightforward, savvy practical advice for businesses large and small. In fact, Fink says that all that is necessary for any business to be vulnerable to economic espionage is just to have at least one competitor and/or one employee. He also reminds us that there are other crises besides international terrorism that we can ill afford to ignore. I've already bought a copy of this book for my boss; and my boss has already put the first of several meetings on how our company can better protect itself from ecomonic espionage on the calendar for next week.

This book also commits the sin of throwing our protagonists into the middle of a relationship within days.

Cole's ex-wife was in a rock band and, after selfishly ignoring his needs for several years, she died in a car accident.

File on the Tsar, is an extremelly well researched investiagtion into an alternative theory about the fate of the Romanovs.Many people dismiss this book because it does not hold that the family was massacred at Ekaterinburg. The fact is that contrary to popular belief the massacre is still a theory, it has not been proven as fact, and the File on the Tsar provides informative generally unknown information on how some of the evidence for a massacre was fabricated.WARNING SPOILERSpoiler; For instance when the massacre theory was first being investigated shortly after the Romanovs disapeared, it was claimed that they were shot in the dinning room, not the basement.Secondly three seperate investigations were conducted, the last investigation is the only one that ever saw light, primarily because it was the most shocking. Early investigators did not find nearly as many bullet holes, bayonet holes, ect . . . as later ones.SPOILERS END HEREEven the discovery of bodies does not prove that the alternative theory in File on the Tsar is untrue. The Imperial grave was opened more then once after the family was believed to have been shot and buried, and the remains could have been disturbed.In short File on the Tsar simply provides comprehensive information, and an alternative theory as to the familys fate, whats more it also could explain the absence of two bodies from the Imperial grve site. The massacre theory does not.Is it somewhat dated? Yes. Unproven by modern science and DNA? No.All scientific and fernsic evidence can equally be used to support the File on the Tsar's theory, as it can the massacre.I recomend if nothing else, that even if you disagree, that you read it."

However, it is remarkably well-researched and has some valuble info, such as the fact that Anastasia and Alexey couldn't possibly have been burned to ashes within one night out in the open. The authors can be forgiven, as it is an attempt to explain the fate of the Romanovs before the definitive DNA analysis concluded that at least 9 of the inhabitants of the Ipatiev house were brutally murdered. Also, it was written before Yurovsky's testimony came to light. I don't think it merits Henry Kissinger's ""crap"" statement about it. It is outdated, but its authors nevertheless command respect from historians. It was right about one thing - that the Sokolov investigation was fixed and Medvedev's testimony is unreliable, as Yurovsky's ""confession"" demonstrates.

Hernandez,1/2,5.0,1329868800,"The compelling side of WWI, monarchy and tragedy","THE FILE ON THE TSAR (2002 edition) by Anthony Summers and Tom Mangold is quite the little book. It is a good, clean and scholarly work dedicated to studying the horrid tale of the execution of the last Czar of Russia and his family. In fact, it endeavors to examine the possibility that at least the Czarina and the children escaped the slaughter that has been peddled more or less successfully to the public for so long.This book carefully dissects various documents and even letters and diaries, piecing together a compelling story about how not only Germany but also England may have planned - even attempted to execute - rescue plans for the Romanov Imperial Family. Did they fail? Is it possible at least part of someone's plan came to fruition?The authors do a terrific job piecing this story together - they even address Anna Manahan, who was alleged to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Note that only the 2002 edition of this book contains a postscript with some deeply moving facts about the DNA testing on the alleged Romanov remains from the Koptyaki Forest. Some scientists don't agree that the testing was properly done. A few don't believe those remains belong to the Romanovs.Interesting chapters include one on various claimants who have surfaced, and the very next chapter is about Anna. These authors do not argue a case for her or against her - but they find so many inconsistencies with the accepted DNA findings and Anna's life story that they wonder aloud whether or not she was Anastasia. But that is only one chapter.This book will thrill you with true stories of intrigues, duplicity that can never be pinned down to the responsible parties, Bolshevik and imperialist propaganda and lies, the whole ugly tamale that gave us a fascinating propaganda pastiche that we continue to accept without a word of wonder. The authors researched this book to perfection, and I am especially appreciative of the notes and bibliography. It is that scholarship that moved the authors to wonder why the public simply accepts everything Russia tells us.The food for thought here has not been changed by any DNA findings. As I said, the book traces a chain of facts that will lead you to wonder about DNA and its validity in this case. For me, the DNA has proved conclusive, I have been forced to that viewpoint - yet this book still intrigues and compels me. Good for the authors, when their book can move a science-minded believer in DNA (I wasn't always, you might be or you might be against it) to wonder about its integrity relative to a particular case.There is no way an interested reader can claim a working knowledge of any of these subjects without having read THE FILE ON THE TSAR - and be certain to get the 2002 edition."

Very interesting read,"Anthony Summers and Tom Mangfold did something extrordinary when they discovered Sokolov's original file on the Tsar. They discovered he had withheld evidence to what he found on the Tsar's murder. The book pretty much dispells of the Sokolov investigation and its faults and is way ahead of its time in that sense. But of course the second half of the book has lost most of its validity since the bodies have been located. But it is interesting how many people claimed to have seen the Empress and her daughters alive and being used by Lenin as pawns. It's a perfect story for those in Russia who still believe that the Romanov bones are not authentic. I think they are though. The part of the book which discusses Anna Anderson is very interesting as well, and makes you wonder how this woman could have truly been a Polish factory girl."

Step by step for beginner/intermediate Oracle DBA.,"This book will guide you not just through what matters in RAC but also on Linux as well.If you're not so familiar with Linux environment, this is the book you gotta read.For instance: the most difficult part of implementing RAC is the installation of the clusterware due to several requirements before the installation actually happens. This book will guide you through the basic steps of:setting up public network cards,private networks cards,creating VIP addresses,bonding two or more network cards,testing them,verify with cluvfy if there is anything else to be done and just then, actually install clusterware software.In other books, all these steps i just mentioned are simply skipped. They just mention what you have to do. This book shows you step by step.These basic steps i just mentioned are linux steps, not oracle for the sake of oracle software. That's why this book is great. You don't have to have the linux bible handy because he tells you step by step what to do.The steps related to oracle are very detailed. He uses very rich pictures to better understand the concepts as well.There are some grammar errors in the text but it's nothing compared to how clear and simple this authors teaches the concepts of RAC. Step by step is very detailed.If you really want something simple, easy, with rich concepts and with step by step for beginner or intermediate skills with Oracle RAC stick with Oracle 10g RAC from Murali Vallath.I think it's important to read more than one book about the same subject so you can compare them.I read another book as well 'Oracle Database 10g Real Application Clusters Handbook' by K GOPALAKRISHNAN. I had the impression that this book would be very good specially because it's from Oracle Press. It's a waste of time and money. Just deep concepts.

B000J16UDQ,The Prophet and the Astronomer,,,,10/12,5.0,1021766400,For anyone who was ever wondered about our fate,"Marcelo Gleiser has written an extremely compelling and accessible book on the science of &quot;the end of the world&quot; theories. It's exciting that science is taking a serious look at this, just as they have with the origins of our universe. It is especially exciting to me that this book is not the type of writing that seemingly only other scientists can understand.-From someone who has never studied physics nor astronomy in a classroom yet wants to know the &quot;real&quot; science behind humanity's &quot;big&quot; questions."
B000J16UDQ,The Prophet and the Astronomer,,A1N2L9A6I686G5,"Katie ""book worm""",3/3,3.0,1125532800,An Interesting Look at Cosmology,"I just finished reading this book, and I must say that it took much longer than usual to get through it. I tended to read it a bit at a time because, although interesting, it was quite hard to get through. The main reason for this, I think, is that it's filled to the brim with physics-related information - and I have little to no physics background with which to understand these concepts. It's because I believe that many others would be stumped by this information as well, that I have rated ""The Prophet & the Astronomer"" a 3.Beyond the complicated physics theories, I found this book to provide quite an interesting look at cosmology through the ages. The author discusses how several hundred years ago, most people believed that such things as comets & shooting stars were actually meant to warn them of bad things to come - famine, war, death, etc... This is how cosmology began to influence, and be influenced by, theology/religion.He then goes on to show how many cults of past & present still use this type of information to scare their followers into continued cult association, and how they also use such things as comets & shooting stars to then explain away why their predictions didn't come about as they said it would - for ex., they might say that they just saw a shooting star, and this means that God has changed his timing...It's also shown how each culture tends to believe that the end of the world will occur in their lifetime - people have been preparing for this for thousands of years...One can see through the progression of this book how some people today still believe much the same things as those in times past re: cosmology & the end. However, now more than ever, science has been at the forefront of this exciting field, as opposed to religion. However, the author believes that science & religion don't have to be on opposite sides of the fence on this issue - as both are essentially trying to answer the same questions.Overall, I would recommend this book to those who have an interest & background in physics in general, and cosmology in particular. I think you will find it an interesting read."
B000J16UDQ,The Prophet and the Astronomer,,,,6/8,3.0,1076976000,interesting but not successful,"I read this book primarily on the basis of the recommendation by Freeman Dyson who wrote that this book gives a clear picture of &quot;science evolving within the culture of religion that gave it birth&quot; At the risk of disagreeing with one of my favoritie science authors I would have to say that this book fails. I cannot think of a single book on the same subject, however, that succeeds. The author writes well but does not convince me that the science of today is motivated by the same instincts and attitudes that underlay the concerns of religion in anything more than a superficial sense. The only book to succeed in my memory was &quot; tao of physics&quot; which , unfortunately was simply wrong.There is a brave attempt to explain inflation theory in an original way, but it too fails. The most interesting chapters are on comets and asteroids, but apart from introducing the subject by pointing out that people had always thought of comets as ill omens there is no real link between how people may have thought then and how or what they think now. The fact is there is a huge difference in our understanding of cosmology. We may want to know about the stars for many of the same reasons. But that is a trivial observation. Science is no longer a religious occupation.In short I think it is another attempt to fill a market niche of &quot;science-religion&quot;, but without any real ideas it fails. I wish Mr. Dyson would actually read the books that he recommends."
B000J16UDQ,The Prophet and the Astronomer,,A1U8DHSI18EEJ1,Richard E. Noble,1/1,5.0,1341100800,The Hobo Philosopher,"The Prophet and the AstronomerBy Marcelo GleiserBook ReviewBy Richard E. Noble""In this book I explore religion's assimilation of cataclysmic cosmic phenomena and its influence on scientific thought through the ages from the pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece to modern day cosmology ... Indeed, I will argue that we create a scientific world as we do a spiritual one - in order to overcome fear, to defy time, to understand our place in the world, and to justify our lives ... Drawing on the Book of Danial, the Book of Revelation, and an investigation of apocalyptic sects, art and literature we will examine the formation and evolution of the solar system, the extinction of dinosaurs, Einstein's general theory of relativity, pulsars and black holes, the big bang and the inflationary universe, all the way to the latest ideas on cosmology.""Reading the above, a curious reader who is not familiar with Marcelo Gleiser might conclude that this is a book by some right wing religious preacher type who is going to do a mystical tap dance on the science of the Universe.Not so.Marcelo Gleiser is the real thing. He is a professor of Natural Philosophy, physics, astronomy at Dartmouth College.If you are like me and found your way to an interest in the origins of the Universe and science in general via early religious training followed by studies of early Greek and Roman philosophers, then you will enjoy reading this book.This author keeps it as simple and understandable as could be expected while dealing with highly complicated cosmological theory and speculative particle physics.The first part of the book was right up my alley. The reader is taken back to before the time of Christ and the Christian era. The author links the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and philosophies to the heavens.We learn about Zoroaster and other pre-Christian like tales. We see how the heavens have always played their part in the hopes and fears of humans. We see the connection between astrology, astronomy, religions and their holy books.We delve into comets and asteroids make connections between then and now. The old superstitions are constantly being updated to our present day superstitions and similarly cultish ideas. The author continually attempts to explain to the reader the difference between religious superstition and science.This is easier said than done.As the author delves more and more deeply into speculative cosmology and particle physics, the Big Bang, black holes and whatnot, the line between the fantasies of the superstitious and the scientific get more and more blurred.The bottom line: ""First and foremost, science does not promise redemption. Science is a human invention preoccupied with understanding the workings of nature ... Science may not offer eternal salvation, but it offers the possibility of a life free from the spiritual slavery caused by the irrational fear of the unknown ... Thales of Miletus during the sixth century B.C.E. tried to understand the workings of nature, without invoking the actions of gods or God.""Despite Thales the author points out repeatedly the many geniuses of science who specifically sought science as their means to establish the truth of their religious beliefs. Isaac Newton stands out among these. Isaac actually gave up his endeavors in science as a waste of his time to delve more deeply into what really mattered ... the Bible and God's revelations.But as the author attempts to assuage our fears with the wonders of science, he exposes us to new real fears.""The conclusion is clear: Earth has been bombarded by large objects in the past and not so distant past, just like all other bodies of the solar system. Scientists use terms like `cosmic pinball', `cosmic shooting gallery', 'target earth' and so forth to illustrate the fact that collisions are an integral part of life in the solar system.""So the end of our world may still be just around the corner, Big Bang or no Big Bang and whether there is a God around that corner or not. The point being that science may not eradicate all our fears but it may provide a rational explanation.That could be considered helpful; then on the other hand, maybe not.""If the history of life on earth, in all its myriad forms, can be understood as an experiment in evolutionary genetics orchestrated by natural selection, the emergence of intelligent life seems to be the result of a chance occurrence, an odd event that would be extremely hard to duplicate elsewhere. The long reign of the dinosaurs ... success and longevity as a species makes it hard to argue for the necessity of intelligent life at the top of the evolutionary chain ... it is much easier to argue for extraterrestrial life than for extraterrestrial intelligent life.""We are all aware via Einstein and his famous theory of relativity that matter can be turned into energy but what about the reverse?""The converse is also true, energy can turn to matter; it is possible for highly energetic photons ... to spontaneously create particles of matter.""Now this is my theory and not the authors.For years I have been reading about a lack of matter in the universe and how nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. It seems that when something (for lack of a more scientific word) approaches the speed of light it gains in mass and consequently slows down. As it continues to slowdown and gains in mass, could it not then turn back into matter at some point along the way?If the answer is yes, then are we not back to the possibility of a steady state universe with matter transforming into energy and energy reforming into matter according and in concordance with the laws concerning the conservation of energy and matter? In which case there is not a lack of matter in the universe. What has always been there, is always there in one form or the other ... and in balance.A few pages later in this book the author criticizes scientific thinkers like Hoyle because their steady state notions suggest that matter must be created ex nihilo (from nothing) to sustain the steady state notion.No, not from nothing does the necessary matter come, but from the energy (light) gaining mass and transforming back into matter.The author is an avid Big Bang supporter. I am not.I try my best to follow along but much of what the author explores in this regard, I feel will all be scrapped as time rolls on.I'm referring to background noise, time having a beginning and ending, that time did not exist prior to the Big Bang, cosmological constants and the super inflationary early universe. All this I find dubious and compensating along with much else that Marcello hypothesizes and speculates upon.But Professor Gleiser's theorizing won't be scrapped by the likes of me. And I intend to keep reading this author. I know one thing for sure. If the science changes, so will Marcelo Gleiser. Because he is a scientist and not a dogmatist ... or a theologian for that matter.Richard Edward Noble author of ""Bits and Pieces"" Hobo Philosopher series."

Alpher, now Emeritus Distinguished Research Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Union College of Union University (Schenectady, NY), and Robert A. Herman, former Professor of Physics and Engineering at the University of Texas.This is an extremely competitive subject. One in which otherwise intellegent persons will lie, cheat and steal ideas to get ahead. I should know. That's my field, so to speak.Dr. Marcelo Gleiser enters the field with this book, following his astoundingly successful 1997 ""The Dancing Universe."" If you go into the area of cosmology AND religion, you are going to butt heads!I recently had the great opportunity to sit in the room while Dr. Gleiser interviewed my father, profiled recently in Discover 99 in an article entitled ""The Last Big Bang Man Left Standing."" He is the last of his generation of Cosmologists during the Golden Era of Physics--the 1930s-1960s. I coin that term here, for the record. I know that Dr. Gleiser, son of immigrants to Brazil from nearby regions of my grandfather--the Ukraine, is a Physicist who actually cares deeply about this connection--for he tried numerous approaches to delve into Dr. Ralph A. Alpher's thinking on the problem. My father has considered this, many times, of course, and written but not published some ideas.Dr. Gleiser, on the other hand, has tackled it in print, the writing is readable to any not-technical person, and I highly recommend it for anyone--whatever side of the creationism controversy the reader has affinity for."

I could quibble with some of the choices he made. He leaves out some things which perhaps he should have included, and includes others which he should have left out. Also, like many modern-day scientists, he sometimes is a little condescending towards ancient philosophers, but in general he does a great job of integrating modern and anicent ideas.My complaint is that the book is the wrong size. I have to admit I am not sure what size it should have been. It is a standard 250-page trade book, but it really should have either been a thin pamphlet or a thick tome-- or possibly a richly illustrated coffee table book a la Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Gleiser's book as it actually exists simultaneously feels like a thin pamphlet with extraneous anecdotes added to pad it out to ""full"" length and like an abridged synopsis of a magnum opus."

A book I still have to this day.Here is a book, with page after page capturing the reader's attention with some visually stunning photography. The colors are vivid, the scenes true to life and captured time and again are real citizens of the Napa Valley (many of them my childhood friends) at home, at play and at work in their vineyards and wineries.The Napa Valley truly is one of the most beautiful places in the US. As a boy I can remember hiking with friends in the hills off Silverado Trail and up towards Mt. Saint Helena and looking over this valley and seeing for as far as the eye can see rolling hills of green vineyards coming alive with yellow mustard flowers. And the product of these vineyards is just about heaven on earth. The wine of some of these wineries is indeed the nectar of the gods.""Napa Wine Country,"" is a superb book. Extremely well written and simple to read. Mr. Roberge writes with an unassuming style that captures the reader and draws you into a place ""...that was created on a day when God was smiling...""Buy this book and loose yourself in the photography, the wording and get to know this land through the eyes of one of America's great authors, Earl Roberge."

B000K1VYTK,Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication,,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,magellan,66/67,5.0,1072224000,Excellent intro text,"This is the second edition and fourth printing of this popular text by Akmajian, Demers, and Harnish at the University of Arizona. Although this text is now over 15 years old, it's still a fine introduction to the subject. One nice thing about the book is that the prose is not too technical for the beginning reader while providing excellent coverage of the important concepts and technical points. This is often a problem with linguistics texts since, unlike other technical subjects, most people have little or no background in linguistics before taking their first real course in the subject, and having previously learned a foreign language isn't as helpful as many students might think since much of linguistics, especially in the transformational grammar and generative grammar and analytical syntax areas, is a highly technical, formal, and even mathematical discipline now.As I am mainly a neuroscientist and secondarily a linguist, I was most interested in Part 3 of this book. The first two parts present the usual linguistics topics such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language variation, and evolution. Part 3 deals with the area of Psycholinguistics, and there are four chapters discussing language from the standpoint of Cognitive Psychology and Neuropsychology. The four chapters are: Pragmatics: The Study of Language Use and Communication; Speech Production and Comprehension; Language Acquisition in Chimp and Child;, and Language and the Brain. The chapter on the brain might be a little too basic for neuroscience students, but it's an excellent introduction for the linguistics students, and I noticed that a number of the classic experiments such as the famous &quot;Wada test&quot; and dichotic listening experiments were discussed, as well as topics like conduction aphasia, Broca's aphasia, Wernicke's aphasia, hemispheric localization and dominance, and so on.Overall still a fine text and worth picking up used if you can find it, when it will be bargain for the price."

Smith,11/11,5.0,1073779200,A second excellent collection,"Unless your interest is specifically political poetry, I recommend reading &quot;Unfortunately, It Was Paradise&quot; before reading &quot;The Adam of Two Edens.&quot; The former is slightly more mature poetry and slightly better translated. While the selections in &quot;The Adam of Two Edens&quot; are poems of political exile, Darwish is not a poet of Palestinian radicalism so much as a poet of the human race. In his poetry, he moves easily between cultures that have inhabited Palestine - Mesopotamian, Kurdish, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Islamic, Christian. This comprehesive view gives his poetry a wisdom and universalism rarely found in contemporary poetry. His poetry is concrete with subtle surprising use of language: &quot;We have only one dream: / that friendly breezes blow / aromas of Arabian coffee / to our hills surrounded by / summer and strangers.&quot; OR &quot;The night is the exact size of my horses.&quot;In an odd way Darwish's understanding of exile is closely related to that of Jabes. Therefore, it seems reasonable to me that Darwish be taught in Israeli schools (see editorial reviews above). &quot;This is my absence, a master who imposes his laws / on the descendants of Lot / and sees no scapegoat for Sodom but myself.&quot;"

I bought the book in English as a gift for a friend of mine, and the translation was a bit disappointing. I did not feel the easy flow of Darwish's distinctive style. It might be that Darwish does not translate well, or that this particular translation is less than perfect. I think the latter is more likely.I still do recommend it."

Broad parody ('Neato Keeno Time', 'Hamburger Hi-jinx') rubs shoulders with barbed social commentary ('MOTORCITY Comics' #1, the Fritz the Cat epic, 'Fritz The No-Good') and lighthearted sexual fantasies ('SNATCH Comics' #1 &amp; 2, 'Dirty Dog'). There's also lots of rarities in this volume (ie: the original front cover for Janis Joplin's 'Cheap Thrills' LP, a previously unpublished alternate cover for 'ZAP' #3, a poster for 'The Zap Show' from 1968, comix from 'The East Village Other' and 'Chicago Seed', etc...).

Crumb draws it as he sees it, lampooning hypocrites of every ilk, from university thinktank eggheads to brutalizing cops to wigged-out counter-culture types with their hippier-than-thou halos and hangups."

Information such as the history of the HP printers and a cross-reference chart of OEM toner cartridges to the authors refilled toner cartridges make up the second half of this book. I later purchased a genuine HP Quick Reference manual for half the price of this book and found it to be far more informative.Perhaps one of the most insulting portions of this book was the constant sales pitches that where made to use the authors refilled toner cartridges. In the event that the charts in the book does not provide you with the information you're seeking, the author supplies you with a phone number to call for more information.

It happens so that Allan Quatermain stops by his Zulu friend's kraal (to those of you who never read Haggard, Kraal=household) to find that yet another friend is madly in love with the well known beauty: Mameena, or, in other words, Child of the Storm. Allan is curious to see this well known Mameena, but his friend who is in love with Mameena (his name is Saduko) goes on a crazy battle to win 100 cattle for Mameena's dowry. After going with Saduko on his quest and helping him win 600 cattle, Allan meets Mameena, and determines she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and, though at that time Africans were thought of as savages (most unjustly, I have to add), Allan, after observing some treachery done by Mameena while pretending to be unconscious, after knowing she was false, cannot find any reason to resist her love to him, for indeed Mameena tries to engage him in a marriage, but Allan remembers her treachery and tells her no. Many adventures follow after that, until the Zulu King declares Mameena a witch, and Mameena pleads guilty. It is not the kind of Salem witchcraft that is talked about here. It is more like herb-knowledge and doctoring that the Zulus call witchcraft. After recieving her death sentence for many more offenses, including causing a civil war and it's outcome, Mameena makes a last wish. The last wish is... You'll have to figure out this as you read along with the mystery of Mameena's character. Suggested background books: Any Allan Quatermain book. Here are some Allan Quatermain titles: Allan and the Holy Flower, Marie, Allan's Wife, King Solomon's Mines, She and Allan, The Ancient Allan, Et cetera."

B000QTD5L6,The Official Book of Hanjie,,A2ETJCYT0DWM4V,Puzzler,29/29,2.0,1170288000,poorly done,"I agree with the other reviewers about the myriad problems with this book.The puzzles are graded as Easy, Medium and Hard depending on the size of the grid the puzzle is printed on, with no actual evaluation of the difficulty of the puzzle itself.The grids are 3 set sizes, and in many cases very poorly related to the size of the puzzle.Easy puzzles are all printed on 25 x 25 grids, but the puzzle images may be much smaller (example, puzzle #7 in which the image is only 25 x 11, and would have been better printed on a 25 x 15 grid; as it is, you are left with 8 empty rows on the top and 6 on the bottom. It's just annoying.) 13 of the 36 ""easy"" puzzles are printed on grids at least 5 lines too large (leaving 5 or more completely empty rows or columns across the top & bottom edges together, or across the right & left sides together).Medium puzzles are on 30 x 30 grids. Of the 26 medium puzzles, I count 12 which have 5 or more completely empty lines at the top/bottom edges or the right/left edges. All of those puzzles should have been put on smaller grids to begin with. One of the more egregious examples is puzzle #45, a very simple 30 x 15 puzzle printed on a 30 x 30 grid (thus graded as ""Medium""), but with 8 empty lines across the top and 7 empty lines across the bottom.Hard puzzles are on 35 x 35 grids. There are 38 in this category and 9 have the same problem of being printed on grids at least 5 rows/columns too large.A major problem with this book: there are quite a few puzzles that do, in fact, require you to guess. An absolute no-no in a logic puzzle book!More minor quibbles with the book:lower grade paper used (thinner and grayer than in other similar books I've enjoyed)the heavy bold grid lines (the ones used every 5 squares vertically and horizontally) don't extend into the clues section. So you have to be especially careful, for example, when working on the bottom section of a 35 x 35 puzzle that the squares you are filling in line up correctly with the line of clues at the top of the puzzle. The bold grid lines every 5 squares usually alleviate this issue, but not when the bold lines don't show in the clues at all!the completed images themselves are, to my mind, inferior to what I've encountered in other puzzle books.

The pictures you end up with are inaccurate, poorly designed, and/or just plain stupid. The first puzzle, for example, is a rectangle hovering over a heavy line that is thicker at the ends, and he calls it a TV set. Then there is a ""Left Arrow"" which is an arrow pointing left with random white spots in it. After the fourth puzzle I look at all the answers in the back and they don't get any better. Even the picture on the cover is a good example of a bad design. While it looks nice at first glance, the tree has poor branch structure, and who would even know or care if you made any mistakes.

B000QTD5L6,The Official Book of Hanjie,,A3GDMDR42JPHTA,Daniel Garman,1/1,1.0,1314144000,A poor choice for this type of puzzle book,"These puzzles are solved by filling in a grid following number clues at the edge of the grid. If the numbers at the edge of the grid are 2, 4 and 9, then in that row/column, you will fill in 2, 4 and 9 consecutive blocks. At the completion, your completed grid will show a picture with your colored in blocks.If you're looking for a ""Hanjie"" puzzle book, this isn't a great choice. This book fails in two ways.First, and most importantly, a true Hanjie / O'Ekaki / Nonogram puzzle must have ONE and ONLY 1 solution. In some of the puzzles, you have a series of blocks that can be completed two ways - both ""proper"" solutions to the puzzles (Ex: in a 4 block square, you could either fill A and D *or* B and C)...1..11 A B1 C DSecond, this book is not designed for someone learning how to do this type of puzzles. As an example, the 5th puzzle in the book (marked as Easy) in most other books would fall in the Difficult section. Rather than completing the puzzle following the numbers, you are required to make assumptions (""If I assume this block is filled in...""), complete a portion of the puzzle until it DOESN'T work, then erase and mark that assumption wrong. This is not acceptable for puzzles marked as Easy. While this may work for experts at these puzzles, and is expected in the harder puzzles, when you combine it with the improper creation of the puzzle(see the first issue), the puzzles become much more trouble than they are worth.If you're still interested in finding a good book, try searching Amazon and the internet for ""O'Ekaki"" and ""Nonograms"".

Now that they are readily available, this book doesn't make the grade.The biggest problem is the unused columns in the grids. It is annoying to have multiple empty rows, sometimes on all four sides. I don't understand why grids of the proper size were not used. This is the first pixel puzzle book that I've had that had these annoying empty rows. Not only is it a bother to have to mark them before you even start the puzzle, but it also makes counting the squares harder. Counting squares is not the fun part of doing these puzzles.Secondly, the pictures created are boring and poorly designed. Sometimes I have to look at the solutions to see what the picture is meant to be. This is after I have correctly solved the puzzle. Other books have pictures that are much more clever than the arrows, hearts, lamps, etc. in this book.Some reviewers have commented that the squares are too big. I rather like that. I can do thses puzzles without wearing glasses, and the big grid amkes it less likely that you will accidently color in the wrong row. However, the typeface of the numbers in the clues are harder to read than a plainer typeface would have been. Also, I don't like the shading in the clue area.I know nothing about the puzzle creator, but I just get the feeling that he does not have a lot of experience with solving or creating pixel puzzles. There is an amateur feel to the puzzles and the pictures.I intend to work all the puzzles in the book, but I would not consider buying another book from this author. If you want good pixel puzzles buy books by Tetsuya Nishio, which are available from amazon."

I bought it several years ago. I solved only 8 puzzels before putting it down in frustration *and* boredom, and have avoided the genre for years, due soley to this book. I recently got a free Picross app for my phone, and loved it enough to buy the pay version. After solving all 384 puzzles in the app, I dug out this book and dusted it off, willing to give it another try. Which resulted in me coming here to post my 1 star review...Logic puzzles (at least easy and medium difficulty) should not make you guess. This book fails.Logic puzzles should not be ambiguous - have multiple 'correct' solutions without providing the desired picture (at ANY difficulty). This book fails.Puzzles should be rewarding, and the reward (other than the sense of accomplishment) for Hanjie puzzles is the completed picture. The pictures should look good or interesting. This book fails. Is it rewarding to make pictures of asymmetric arrows (yes, multiple puzzle were of an arrow, just pointed in different directions), a box, or a crooked 'X'? A significant number of the pictures had filled in or unfilled squares where they should not be. It is as if the author did a really bad job of scanning in grade school crayon drawings, and didn't bother cleaning them up. Fail.""The Official Book of Hanjie""? Official? With whom did they register to make it official? Would not an ""official"" puzzle book have more than the very basic instructions? Fail. Fail. Fail.The only place where I disagree with some other reviewers is in that this book might be ok for some skill levels. Some say ok for beginner. Some say ok for expert. I say ok for none. Beginners would be bored with the over simple, uninspired puzzles, and extremely frustrated with the ambiguous/cheat ones. Experts would mostly be bored. And even if you are an expert, it isn't any more fun to have an ambiguous puzzle. Or lame pictures.At all costs, avoid any book that this author (Timothy E.

Rumpole is a good sort, who seems often the underdog, but deep down he is the barrister who would be the champion for the unjust."

It addds much to the pleasure of reading Rumpole to get to know him as he develops over the course of the original stories.

They're one of the few mystery series which don't lose enjoyment even after you've seen the film adaptations. My favorite Rumpoles are probably Rumpole a la Carte and Rumpole on Trial; this &quot;Best of&quot; compilation features stories, chosen by Mortimer, from several different eras, including Rumpole's very first appearance. The book is a good way to get acquainted with Rumpole, and it also makes a great gift.The only possible downside is that, after reading the Rumpole stories, you may think that Mortimer's other fiction doesn't *quite* measure up.

We follow Rumpole through various cases, which give us an insight into Rumpole's views of life and the law (he is quite scathing of both). We meet various regular inhabitants of the Rumpole stories - the Timosn family, who with their many and varied exploits provide Rumpole with much work; 'Miz Liz' Probert, Rumpole's feminist prot&eacute;g&eacute;; uncle Tom, who hasn't seen a brief for many a year and spends his days in chambers practicing his putting; and many others. While very humourous, some of the humour is a bit dated, though this may be part of its appeal for some.The book is a collection of short stories, originally published elsewhere, and each stands alone. so you are able to dip in and out of this book. I am not really a fan of legal stories, humourous or otherwise, but in short dose these make a light break.

Most Catholics I believe go through their entire lives not having any idea just how ancient most of these customs are. Adult converts to the Church are given instruction in most of these customs but that instruction usually stops with the why and seldom reaches into the beautiful history of these customs. Even when the RCIA instruction does cover all of the bases and even when the cradle Catholic has been thoroughly schooled in the history and tradition of the Church much of that instruction and education gets lost along the way. There is just so much information that the human brain can absorb and learning all that there is to know about the majesty, history and glory of the Roman Catholic Church is simply beyond the average person's capacity.That is why wonderful little books like this one are so important. This author gives the reader a concise but thorough explanation of some of the most important customs and traditions of the Catholic Church. Each subject is covered in only a few short pages or sometimes only paragraphs but all of the basics are there. The physical action required for the customs is explained very clearly so that for example someone who had never seen anyone genuflect could easily picture the action in their mind's eye. The author then tackles both the scriptural and traditional reasons for the custom and when the custom is practiced somewhat differently from one region to another he explains the differences and the reasons for them.Personally speaking I picked up a lot of information about the history of some of our most cherished customs and how they had first come to be practiced. For example many, if not most of our modern practices can easily be traced as far back as the early Church because of images found in the Roman catacombs. I also learned a great deal about some other customs on which I was a little fuzzy like indulgences and scapulars. The very simplicity with which this author explains these things is what makes this such a fine little book. Simply put, you don't have to be a theologian to actually understand what the author is talking about and areas that have never been quite clear will begin to come into brilliant focus.I did find one little typo on page 135 which is not the author's fault but the publisher might want to correct it in future editions, of which there ought to be many. I also found the author's description of a set of Rosary beads to be a little confusing and there are very few people more familiar with Rosary Beads than I. On the other hand I found in the Rosary section that the old English word bead meant, ""to pray"" which was a bit of completely new and fascinating information, at least it was for me.Don't expect heavy theology or in depth analysis from this book but as a primer on why we Catholics do some of the things that we do this book can't be beat."

0915238152,The art of Zen meditation,,A1RBBVNQRQKU9F,Sathish Srinivasan,5/5,5.0,1015459200,A good guide for meditation,"Meditation as I see it is a process of intense concentration on a particular duty at hand. This I feel relieves the subconcious mind to work on important aspects of life without the interference of mundane thought.The humble non-pushy approach of the author is the first striking thing about this book . He gives a wonderful idea about zen and the purpose of meditation. I found his approach very useful.Let me tell a few things that I have learnt about meditation. It might be useful for you too. Our mind has a compulsive need to flow. It always thinks about the past or plans for the future or just dreams. It hardly stays in the present. It is reflected not only in our thought preocess but also in our overall living. We interpret the reality by our experience and knowledge. There is a famous zen story. Once a student wanted to know what zen really means. He raised his question to a zen master with great expectations. But, the master remained still as if he did'nt even hear the student's question. Many say that real zen masters realize the complexity of zen that they dont talk about it. But, in my opinion he did answer the question, and I feel complete silence is what zen is all about. The complete stillness of mind where it becomes one with the universe and becomes aware of reality without any contamination of the thought process is what we are trying to achieve through meditation. As Fast points out, one of the purposes of meditation is to stay in the present. Relaxation of body and concentration of the thought on our breathing will be very useful to achieve this (This book explains the method wonderfully). I would like to mention here that our mind has been programmed to flow for so many years that we should not get discouraged or feel guilty with initial failures. We should practice, persevere and be patient with ourselves during our practices. The decision to be patient with ourselves will be a great boost in learning this art. Also, our mind has the character of branching out. One thought comes in, we interpret it and it branches out in another direction, we interpret again and it branches again and the process continues. When we meditate we should try and not interpret any of the passing thoughts forcefully. This will assist in our mind becoming calm as the practice proceeds. Concentration on some words like ""om"" or "" ave maria"" or just ""relax"" with that in mind helps a lot too.I read this book along with "" Zen in the art of archery"" and I suggest this combination for others too."

The authors share their vast knowledge of all things Andean, going far beyond Machu Picchu and other sites of Peru in much greater depth than the usual tour books. This book is very readable, very approachable, and the reader comes to know how deeply the authors love Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the people of the Andes. The book is enhanced by outstanding stories of the people and by splendid photography (color as well as black and white).Bottom line: I love this book.The book has the information of an encyclopedia without the dryness and some might say without the organization. It is like a syncopated fountain, flowing with details, dotted with definitions and poetic words of the people. Information is often repeated in different contexts so that at the end the reader has really learned something. That something is likely to be very personal to each reader. It may include a knowledge of Andean cosmology and a familiarity with the three worlds of Hanakpacha (upper world, represented by the condor), Kaypacha (present world, represented by the puma), and Ukhupacha (lower or inner world, represented by the snake). Along the journey, the reader will come to know and feel the protection of the apukuna (deities of the mountains) and to appreciate the connection we all have to Pachamama and to each other. The reader can also delve into sacred sites, healing ceremonies, daily life, the rich language, dream material, medicinal healing techniques, and so many other subjects.Like an incredible tapestry, the book weaves together the personal stories of the authors, plus the tales and traditions of many others. One of the most moving &quot;stories&quot; in the book is related by Aurelio Aguirre, telling of his experience as a guide for an Italian group, whose members may have literally saved his life. The tale keenly illustrates the interconnectedness of spiritual seekers--the learning and teaching and healing that ties us together, whether Andean or not, whether traveling in person or through books, in fact whether &quot;seeking&quot; or not.This reviewer is no expert on Peru, but I recently returned from my first trip there, during which time this book was published. I know that when (not if) I return to the Andes, this book will accompany me. While in Peru, I had the good fortune to meet Carol Cumes and some of the people whose stories fill this book. They are real, as authentic as can be.Enjoy this book and see where the journey takes you!"

In Like a Sister, Janice Daugharty has grippingly captured the small town rural life of a 13-year old girl known as Sister. But Sister is not merely a sister, she must also be a surrogate mother to her younger siblings because their mother is too immersed in her own sorry life to care for them. Sister, despite poverty and lack of adult supervision, strives to better herself and to &quot;be good.&quot; Sister is endearing and attracts the too-familiar attentions of an opportunistic older man. Her small town world then becomes a minefield with constant dangers to herself, her good-for-nothing mother, her younger twin brothers and baby sister, and eventually even her wonderful neighbor. Ms. Daugharty's characters take shape so clearly that one can easily understand their complexities. Through her strong narrative, you grasp the caring yet smothering sensation of life in a rural South Georgia backwater town. I highly recommend this book, as well as all others by Ms. Daugharty."

I think it a great read.Sister's world is ugly. Daughtery uses deadly accurate prose to depict the starkness of Sister's life. Daugharty is also particularly convincing at portraying the confusion and pain of a thirteen-year-old trying to negotiate life with little information and no parental support. But in all the ugliness, there are, for Sister, threads of gold-the physical pleasure of holding her baby sister, Lil; the resigned kindness of the Judge who has the power to take Lil away, and does; the compassion of Willa, her neighbor, who becomes Sister's redeemer. And so Daugharty weaves these threads, makes a net for Sister, and the net is hope. How the heck does Daugharty get THERE? Read &quot;Like A Sister.&quot; You'll see."

Warfield,1/1,5.0,1334534400,Like a Sister by Janice Daugharty,"Several times while reading ""Like a Sister"" by Janice Daugharty, I had to stop and think about what I had just read. Sister, a young teenager and barely a teenager at that, being thirteen, left with twin brothers and a baby to take care of for the summer, had these siblings dumped on her by her mother and her mother's boyfriend. Everywhere she went, Sister had Baby Lill on her hip. When she turned fourteen, Sister didn't even want to tell anyone on September 10 that it was her birthday. No one remembered, anyway. My own daughter's birthday, September 10, and I had to stop and think about the birthday cakes, presents, cards, family and friends who made it special at that age. But Sister's mother, Marnie, and Marnie's boyfriend, Sade, were too busy running their cafe in Cornerville, GA to remember Sister's birthday or even the girl herself. Too busy prostituting and fighting most of the time while the twin boys ran wild and people whispered that the baby was really Sister's.""Like a Sister"" is a story of living poor and alone in southern Georgia. There is never food in Sister's house and the best she can do is to take the baby to a nearby store and play on the sympathy of the store owner who lets her have a few candy bars and later on, some baby food. The boys and Sister scrounge up what they can, and it's usually a candy bar and sometimes Spaghetti-os. They can't depend on their mother at all, but Sister still loves her mother and wants her mom to be home with her. She misses all that a mother should be to her.It's a fortunate thing for Sister that a neighbor named Willa notices the conditions that they live in and recognizes that the mother worries only about herself. Sister becomes a friend and she visits Willa who has daughters around the same age. There are home-cooked meals and what appears to be a real family who sits on the porch after dinner, and the girls have pretty dresses that their mother sews for them. It is 1956 and Willa is the perfect homemaker who cares for her family and home. Sister notices that there are always good smells coming from Willa's kitchen, and during school Willa babysits little Lill. Marnie is two months behind paying Willa for babysitting.Sister goes to church on Sundays with her brothers and the baby in tow. She realizes that she can ""rise above"" the way she appears and the way she is living by going to Sunday School and church and trying to better herself and her brothers. She enjoys church until a new bigshot in town makes her take the fussy baby out of church and then wants to have a word with her. He has noticed Sister's attractiveness and Sister's life is about to change.""Like a Sister"" is a heartbreaking story of a mother who has lost her way, and of her daughter who has some pride in herself and the determination to try to do the best she can at such a young age to raise her brothers and baby sister on her own. There are twists and turns in this book that made it a page-turner for me. This is another of Janice Daugharty's books that will stay with me for a long time to come.

0701114290,Palladian,,A35JTVM6A5T2VF,Richard R. Horton,4/4,4.0,1147305600,"Delicately funny, acute, honest -- not Taylor's best but fine work","Elizabeth Taylor's Palladian is this wonderful mid-century English writer's second novel, from 1946. (Perhaps needless to say, she was not the actress.) I'd previously read and enjoyed her first novel, At Mrs. Lippincote's as well as two late novels, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont (one of the great old age novels), and The Wedding Group. Taylor was one of the great run of social comic writers in England at that time. (Along with Kingsley Amis, Barbara Pym, Muriel Spark among others.)The nominal protagonist of Palladian is Cassandra Dashwood, who becomes governess to Sophy, daughter of a rather ineffectual widower, Marion Vanbrugh, who lives in a decayed manor house with his drunk cousin Tom, Tom's pregnant sister Margaret, a couple of not very respectful servants, and Tom and Margaret's somewhat dotty mother. Cassandra is a romantical young woman who determines in advance to fall in love with Marion. And so she does. But that is a small part of the story. More important, perhaps, is Tom's tawdry relationship with the local publican's wife, and Tom's secret past involving Marion's dead wife. There are also telling tidbits from the POV of the two servants. Margaret's rather bossy and excessively bracing nature. Sophy is depicted as a pretty normal girl of her age, not at all a prodigy, desperate about her failure to be the beauty her mother was.The novel turns on a shocking event with about 40 pages to go. I admit I put the book down for a day or so at that point -- it seemed unearned, unfair. But -- though I am still unsure that that plot development works -- Taylor still brings home the novel quite effectively. It's by no means her best novel, but it's fine work. Delicately funny, acute, honest about its characters' failings but still fair to them. Taylor was a fan of Jane Austen, which is fairly clear in all her work, but perhaps never more so than here, as indicated by her protagonist's name, by the reference to the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier vehicle PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, which is shown at the local theater, and by a couple further overt references to Austen."
0701114290,Palladian,,A106016KSI0YQ,Jay Dickson,3/5,3.0,1117670400,Some like it cold,"Elizabeth Taylor is a real writer's writer, which can be a term of disparagement as well as one of high praise. Taylor's novels always show amazing intelligence and care and devotion to craft, and at their best they can be moving and obsorbing; at their worst, however, they can seem a bit inhuman and cold. PALLADIAN, her second novel, falls into the latter category. This is truly a metanarrative, as its clever-clever title would indicate, suggesting not only the Palladian architecture of the estate on which most of the action takes place but also the realms of the intellectual, of Pallas Athena. The Austenian-named heroine Cassandra Dashwood goes to work at the estate as a governess, and dreams from the first of falling in love with her charge's widowed and mysterious father; Taylor acts immediately to deconstruct any such Brontsque narrative expectations by showing quickly that the true locus of interest should lie not with Cassandra and her employer but rather with her employer's dislikeable drunken cousin, who is sleeping with a pubkeeper in the nearby town. Characters are coldly sacrificed for the sake of narrative surprises and moral points; you end up admiring Taylor's skill and fine mind but not caring a bit for anyone in the novel at all."

When applied cleverly, that writing strategy leads to some great books. This is one of them.Dickson covers the history of rocketry and missiles, taking a look at the science and the scientists that led up to the launch of Sputnik. He captures the mood of the Cold War and gives you a sense of the rude awakening the United States experienced when the USSR beat it into space. Then the book ranges into the responses of the US and the USSR to Sputnik, covering the space race to its end on the moon.All of the material is carefully brought together and conveyed in such a way that you keep reading long after you needed to put the book down and do something else.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys history.

0425188434,Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters),,A1OSPY4MSOLE5V,S. M Marson,0/0,5.0,1193788800,Government!,"I vividly remember the Sputnik announcement when I was 6 years old. Gradually, I became part of the cohort of the concerned. By my seventh birthday, I worriedly discuss the possibility of a Soviet bomb hurtling down from a satellite to kill all Americans. My cousin, Mark (older and wiser), reassured me that bombs from satellites were not possible. On a piece of paper he drew a picture of an object falling from outer space. ""They burn up before they hit the ground,"" he explained. This seven year old's analysis was reassuring and I became less panicky. Later, of course, I learned that my cousin was wrong -- things could fall from space without burning up.Frankly, I am glad that I (and other Americans) didn't know the content of Dickson's work when Sputnik was beeping. The Sputnik ""freak out"" would have been far worse! Dickson demonstrates a history of lack of vision. It should come to no surprise that the US government and military were unable create a policy that would maintain technological advances. If the Soviets wanted to stifle our process toward outer space, they couldn't have done a better job than our governmental incompetence. If it weren't governmental meddling, I am sure we would have a colony on Mars now.The eerie aspect to understanding the historical circumstances of Sputnik involves two dimensions. First, I see a continuation of gross incompetent government leadership. Things haven't changed. We can't seem to construct a coherent immigration policy. Our military lacks an effective strategy to combat guerilla warfare (we call it ""insurgency""). Our governmental leaders are only recently admitting that global warming might be a problem. It is Sputnik all over again. Second, one can quickly recognize our weak educational system. At the beginning of the space race, we used our brains and the slide rule. With the technological advances associated with micro chip, Dickson demonstrates that we have an increasing proportion of engineering disasters like bridge collapses. We seem to be witnessing an increase proportion of senility. Perhaps, we need to surrender our computers and return to the slide rule!Dickson is a crafty writer. Although Sputnik is well-documented piece of nonfiction (great footnotes), it reads like fiction. If one enjoys reading about history, technology or incompetent governmental officials, I highly recommend SPUTNIK."

The book reveals how President Eisenhower remained calm and determined as America in 1957 came close to panic over &quot;The Shock of the Century&quot; -- the Soviet Union's launch of the world's first satellite. The crises that America faces today make the book remarkable timely. Dickson tells the exciting story of how Eisenhower steadfastly stood up to powerful domestic forces: hot-headed politicians, panic-stricken pundits, trigger-fingered military and ""Strangelove"" missile-men - all led by Nazi hero Wernher von Braun - who would have surely used their beloved V-2 rockets to move the world toward a buzz-bomb Armageddon. Instead, Eisenhower quietly and resolutely directed levelheaded scientists and trusted military in America's achieving undisputed space leadership.

I learned a lot about the times leading up to the launch, the flight itself, and the immediate aftermath.The main negative about the book that stands out in my mind is how people over stated the significance of Sputnik. I had always thought Sputnik caught the US and the rest of the world completely by surprise. Instead, the book relates as to how both the US and USSR had further rocket research and technology since WW II and that both countries had announced that they would launch satellites during the period of 1 July 1957 through 31 December 1958. The Soviets dropped hints left and right that they were about to launch a satellite and most people either chose to ignore them or did not believe them. After reading about that, the &quot;shock value&quot; of a tiny little satellite sending peeping sounds around the world was somewhat diminished.Sputnik did indeed have an impact upon the US and its society. But I am not certain that much of what transpired the following decades in space exploration would have been much different than if the US had, as Dr. Werner Von Braun had aspired, been the first to launch a satellite. A space race would have occurred regardless, in my opinion. After reading the book, I cannot subscribe to the thought that Sputnik radically altered the direction of space exploration. Both countries were heading in that direction already.The title itself was a little misleading, but perhaps necessarily so from a marketing standpoint. As the book addressed far more than just Sputnik, a more accurate title might have been something along the lines of &quot;The Race For Space&quot; or &quot;The Space Race - The Early Years&quot;. But such a title probably would not have been the attention grabber than a simple title like &quot;Sputnik&quot;."

Bille,1/3,3.0,1001548800,A Good Contribution to Space History,"Paul Dickson has done a good job of telling a great story - the events leading up to and following the launch of Sputnik 1. He has done the most thorough job of research on this topic of any author to date, and is especially good at sprinking anecdotes which illustrate the political and personal aspects of the race into space and the aftermath of the Soviet victory.There are some mistakes in the book. Dickson's statement that Sputnik carried only a transmitter and no instrumentation is an error (as he has acknowledged and intends to correct). The author never does prove his claim from the Introduction that President Eisenhower &quot;welcomed the launch.&quot; He does explain well how and why the President, focused on keeping space open for future reconnaissance satellites, was not nearly so upset by Sputnik as most DC politicos were. Dickson also doesn't explain clearly that those who &quot;saw Sputnik&quot; actually saw the booster rocket - the satellite was invisible to the naked eye. Finally, the book has a bit of a padded feel, with asides on everything from The Femininine Mystique to the the creation of the Internet. Some of these are only vaguely related to Sputnik.The general reader won't be put off by the dearth of footnotes, espcially since the chapter notes and bibliography are good. As a fellow space history enthusiast, I would have liked more specific sources for some statements and anecdotes.The bottom line, though, is that this is a valuable addition to space history."

However, if you know anything about this period you will find little of interest. The author is, after all, not a space historian, nor did he have an active part in the space age.

How these two dates could be incorrect makes me just a little skeptical that other things I read in the book might just be a little off as well. What if a book on early US history listed Jefferson as the 4th President?I really wanted to like this book, and altough it tended to be a little dry at times, I found many interesting stories and details, but two blatant factual inaccuracies that made it past however many people they made it past before the book's printing left me a little wary of the rest of the content.

0425188434,Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters),,A1XXJ6I7K2I7SI,"R. Hardy ""Rob Hardy""",9/10,5.0,1004313600,Sputnik is Still Flying,"On 4 October 1957, the world woke up in the space age. The first artificial satellite (people were originally calling it an artificial moon) had been successfully launched by the Soviet Union. It weighed less than 200 pounds and was only as big as a basketball, its batteries died after three weeks whereupon it went silent, and after three months aloft it disintegrated upon reentry into the atmosphere. This tiny and ephemeral ball made huge differences in science and the world political climate, and in Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Walker &amp; Co.), Paul Dickson has reviewed them all. He has also given a history of what led up to successful launches of satellites in both the Soviet Union and the US, so that his book is a useful review not just of the first satellite but of twentieth century space exploration in general.The Russians already had a relatively long history of thinking about space before Sputnik went up. The visionary Tsiolovsky was a self-taught scholar who in 1898 created the first formula to specify what sort of power would be needed to send an object up so as not to fall down again. He described that this could be accomplished by a &quot;reaction machine,&quot; which we know as a rocket. He never got to use models, but his first sketch of a spaceship had fuel tanks of liquid oxygen and hydrogen, just as the shuttle uses. He described the use of booster rockets to attain escape velocity. Of course, Dickson tells the fascinating story of our own neglected rocket man, Robert Goddard, who made real rockets and gained over 200 patents, but mostly got only posthumous credit for his accomplishments. And then there was Sergei Korolev, a Red Army Colonel, who, as &quot;chief designer&quot; of the Soviet rocket program, was the man responsible for Sputnik, and for Gagarin's 1961 spaceflight. Little was known about him at the time, because the Soviets wanted their space efforts to be seen as a communal, rather than an individual, effort, and they thought that if he were known, he would be a target for CIA assassination. He had also been imprisoned in the Gulag when Stalin came to believe that rockets would be used to overthrow the government. Dickson reviews the worry with which Americans viewed Sputnik, and how Eisenhower (who was criticized for not worrying enough) actually was pleased that it opened up space for spy satellites.American science and technology were in trouble in some ways. Dickson details the rivalry between the services to claim space as a theater of operations, and the rivalry between military and civilian agencies. There were problems of underfunding of basic research. Science within education needed higher priorities, and for many schools, the Sputnik era was the first time that Darwin could be mentioned. Sputnik resulted in a meaningful American space program, and Dickson's readable and informative re-evaluation of the repercussions of the little aluminum ball shows that it affects us still."

Both?,"Paul Dickson argues in his book ""Sputnik: The shock of the Century"" that this little 184 pound satellite launched by the Soviets in October 1957 changed the world. He says that it changed the way Americans thought, and that it paved the way for our own space program.I agree that it was a shocking event and quite a blow to the pride of the United States - to see the Soviets launch an artificial Earth orbiting satellite before we could do it? Unheard of! I don't think that it changed the world quite as much as Dickson claims, however.At the close of his book, Dickson says that the two most important marvels of the 20th century were Sputnik and the Internet. Certainly leaves a lot of room for discussion, doesn't it?I believe that Dickson has done us quite a service by writing this book - it is a great history both of the space race up to, and including, an introduction to both the Apollo and Gemini missions of the 1960's, as well as the social history that acompanied this massive PR coup by the Soviets.I especially enjoyed the way that Dickson explained how much America focused on education (science, math, and the like) after the Soviets beat us into space. I also tremendously enjoyed the role of Werner Von Braun in our own efforts to launch a satellite. However, I think that this book easily could have been much, much larger in order to adequately cover the primary topic - Sputnik and all of the ramifications of that fateful day in October."

Beautiful as well as intelligent and strong, she's been the one that has kept the family of 3 boys and one girl (the stunning and talented Louise Dorsey) together, and ""stood by her man"" through thick and thin. Popea writes a portion of Chapter Fifteen with gritty honesty, and explains how, and why, she withstood the many women, the paternity suits, and all the paparazzi that hounded them through those many years of notoriety.The women, as Engelbert explains, were an ""occupational hazard"", certainly not helped by his years of lonely nights and hard drinking on the road, and the many females who would make themselves exceedingly available.Engelbert comes off as an extremely complex individual, but very likeable. A perfectionist in his work, living life to the fullest, and discovering in his later years that he has the gift of healing; this assertion I believe, as I find that the sound of his voice can have curative effects.There are portions that are laugh-out-loud funny (like the UFO story in Chapter Seventeen), and adding to the charm of his writing style is some of the ""Brit-speak"" slang, with expressions like the now rarely heard ""grotty"" (a favorite word of mine coined by George Harrison in the '60s).The book has two sections of photographs, from the age of 17 on. Favorites of mine are the one with Muhammad Ali, and a lovely family shot taken by the pool in one of their USA homes, affectionately named ""The Pink Palace"".The final 12 pages are devoted to a UK discography, and include chart positions.This is fast reading, and riveting, so walk the dog, feed the cat, turn off the telephone, and make yourself a big cuppa, because once you open this book, its going to be very hard to put down."

Thandeka's book is about how children are taught racism. It begins with a series of anecdotes about how various children were taught racism; for example, one little boy invited his friends to his birthday party, to the evident consternation of his parents, who let him know in no uncertain terms that inviting black friends into his home was NOT acceptable behavior. He was made to feel that he had done something very wrong.Young children, dependent on their parents for their very survival, are in no position to question the rightness of their parents' teachings, even when they may feel something is wrong. Survival requires them to conclude that the fault is theirs, and they must accept what they are taught and adjust their feelings accordingly.As I read this book, I recognized my parents' failed attempts to teach me to be white. They started too late; I had already decided I did not want to be a racist. I grew up in a town where there were no black families, so it wasn't until I was 16 that I was subjected to an attack from my mother because I had been greatly impressed (and told her parents so) with the intelligence of a girl I had met who, unbeknownst to me, had a slight admixture of ""Negro"" ancestry. When the reason behind her attack finally came out, my instant response was to tell my mother that she ought to be ashamed of herself, and that I was ashamed of her for demanding that I act in a dishonorable (i. e. racist) manner, a demand that I would never consider obeying.Read this book. It will help many of you to understand your own life experience, and perhaps to overcome some conditioning you should never have had, and to avoid doing the same harm to your children. For those of you fortunate enough never to have been taught ""to be white"" it will help you understand and perhaps help those of your friends and acquaintences who were.This is a book that should be in every school library.watziznaym@gmail.com"

I do feel however that she could have elaborated more, but I do not see most people reading the dozens of books that she could have produced at one sitting.Thandeka does a wonderful job of weaving together allusions and stories to produce a work that is a quality resource. I think it is a beautiful start to facing our extremities interculturally. In my limited experience I have seen cultures that overlap and work well together, so when broad sweeping generalizations are required to convey I think it becomes time to pay a little more attention to the underdogs in the world.

Most white people, including myself, have a true blind spot about our assumptions about people of color as well as about being white. This bookLearning to Be White: Money, Race, and God in America, which I am still reading, opened my eyes to how we, at a very young age, start learning to recognize difference between races from our caretakers.Thandeka writes about childhood incidents which are only too common, such as, parents making it clear that a new friend of color is not a welcome friend and not welcome in the home, a new boyfriend of color, also not approved of or welcome. As children we accept thi s, as we depend on our caretakers (parents) for love and a place of belonging.There is much that white people take for granted that is ours simply because we are white. As Thandeka states it, we, as white people are ""in the driver's seat.""Thandeka also writes about the difficult assimilation of immigrants to the United States and how these people have been taught to become racist by the white people with power. A very difficult read at times, not a ""fun book,"" but very eye-opening. A book I recommend reading to illuminate those blind spots about race."

The title of &quot;Learning to be White...&quot; leads one to believe that the issue discussed is, indeed, racism. When, in fact, Thandeka does little more than use race and racial references describing the human tendency to hang out with the &quot;tribe&quot;. Whether the subjects of her study are white, black, hispanic, or other tribal thinking people, the issues of moving outside one's own social group are the same. Black kids bringing home white friends suffer the same shame and threat of abandonment that white kids do.

However, I have not seen them applying the responses to real life situations without my direction, and I think it is because the situations in the book are so humorously outrageous. I know, humor is great for kids and it does make the book enjoyable. It just makes the book hard to apply for the kids I think.It is a little more verbally graphic than what I care for, too, i.e. If someone asks you 'do you want me to shoot a hole in your head' what do you say?So, in summary, it's cute, but not great."

What do you say when you're walking backwards to town (because you like to do that) and bump into an alligator? What do you say when you're flying your plane and remember the Duchess asked you to drop in, so you do and break her roof?It's silliness incarnate, and you have to love it!There are three scenarios in particular that reviewers have commented on, so let's tackle those.The first is the ""decapitation"". In this case you're asked what you say when you're out picking flowers in front of your castle, a dragon appears and breathes smoke at you, and then a knight saves you by chopping off its head. (You say thank you.)There's no blood or anything gory shown, and as far as I'm concerned the princess being saved from the dragon by the knight is a common fairy tale set-up. I don't have a problem with this. There are more violent scenes in both classic and recent Disney animated films, nobody is claiming the dragon was talking and friendly and just violently attacked - I have no problem with this scene for this age group. Let's move on.The next one is where you are a cowboy. Suddenly the bad guy shows up and holds a gun to your head and asks ""Would you like me to shoot a hole in your head?"" (You say ""no thank you"", which strikes me as perfectly sensible.)This one is a bit trickier. I'll be honest and skip ahead a bit by saying I, personally have no problem with ANY of this book - but in this case I can really see why some people do. The scene is a bit explicit, and the Western is no longer a popular form of drama anyway so it's not like this situation is likely to have come up in your child's play.However, as nobody actually gets hurt, I'd say most kids won't even notice to be upset. There's more violent scenes on cartoons in the morning.And the last one that people have complained about is the one where you're a pirate and have captured a lady and tied her up. Every morning when you untie her to eat breakfast she says ""Good morning, how are you?"" and you are supposed to say the same.As far as this goes... meh. Clearly nobody is being particularly ill-treated.Now, overall, I don't mind any of these scenes because I know quite a few children. This sort of thing and more is exactly what they come up with when they're playing pretend. If you think children do not play-act violence you are very much mistaken. They do. They do it because it's exciting. They do it because it's fun to practice being really bad in a safe way that doesn't actually harm anyone, when in real life they work so hard to be GOOD. They do it because these things scare them and playing them makes them less scary. They do because the stories they are exposed to have violence there, explicit or implied, and they want to understand that. They do because you can't have a good story without a villain.And children have been doing this for as long as there have been children to play pretend at all. I do not believe that this is in any way linked to actual violence when these children grow up.Obviously if your child is bothered by this sort of pretend violence, don't read them this book. Or if you are. However, truthfully, I don't think it's that big a deal in this context."

(Also, after reading that well put review, it is clear to me they intended to give the book FIVE stars, not ONE :) - so, I need to help that average rating.)Russ Garcia has written a non-pretentious tell it like it is book that would jump-start ANY musician at any level. It has the unusual ability to be both simple and probing. Written in an age before political correctness - he makes certain sweeping statements like &quot;this type of chord is PRETTY&quot;. I *LOVED* that, because in music, there are certain universals. It's not about rules (Russ makes that clear), and it doesn't mean these &quot;universals&quot; are written in stone exactly, but let's face it, folks; Major 7th chords ARE &quot;pretty&quot;.Although written in the fifties, &quot;The Professional Arranger Composer: Book 1&quot; is forward looking. Russ was obviously for experimentation and new ideas. I got it in 1974, and although I wasn't into some of the genres he mentions and covers, the ideas behind them were easily converted to my areas of interest. It would be the same now. Russ Garcia knew that in music the times were changing. But he floods the reader with many usable ideas that can make you arrange better, compose better, or play your instrument better (probably particularly keyboards, but I'm certain other instruments as well). I've been arranging and composing for years, and I am always thankful I found this book fairly early on. I've got a whole shelf of music books, from a four-part Julliard series on Jazz to a very nice book from Henri Mancini called Sounds and Scores that has audio examples... on vinyl, no less... and although they've all been helpful, I think Mr. Garcia takes the cake. Mr. Mancini is HIGH on the list, though!!The Professional Arranger Composer comes in Book 1 &amp; Book 2. I recently got Book 2, having looked for ages to find it. Book 1 looks like he wrote on score paper with a felt tip pen, and he left it that way on purpose. SMART! It takes it away from any sort of lofty academic realm and helps to bring the message home. The writing does the same. Russ WANTS you to exceed, excel, and make music! Between the two books, if you only get one book, go for Book 1. Book two loses the &quot;look and feel&quot;, and although some of the tone remains, it basically extends Book 1, but perhaps in a not as easy to digest way. Book 1 becomes your friend; a book to wear out and buy again (it's paperback ONLY).Strike up the BAND!!"

It is easy to read, and the neat, hand-written notation gives it a casual charm. Garcia provides lots of practical advice and tips on how to use (and avoid over-using) arranging techniques. This is not just a collection of material on the ranges of instruments, etc. but rather has lots of info on how to blend ensembles together. The emphasis is more on large ""bands"" (including string sections as needed) rather than full-on classical orchestration. (Think of scores/arrangements by Henry Mancini, Nelson Riddle, or Quincy Jones rather than Ravel or Mahler, in other words.) For classical scores, I'd recommend Rimsky-Korsakov and Walter Piston's classic works on orchestration, though you can still learn a lot from Garcia."

I'm a professional jazz pianist and occasional composer/arranger. It was an important part of my basic education.I also agree with reviewer no. 2 that the handwritten look of it is a plus. This is the way all custom arrangements were written for many years, before the advent of the personal computer and music writing software.It's not written with a felt-tipped pen, but with a broad-nibbed music writing pen using India or other permanent black ink.There are other, more comprehensive (and more expensive) books out there, excellent ones, but Garcia's is a superb introduction to all the fundamentals every aspiring arranger needs."

B0006DEB1K,Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series),,A2XAJZNLBMC1WH,D. Moore,21/23,5.0,1213833600,"A fascinating book that ought to be taken seriously, even if rejected","This is a difficult book - allow me to attempt to review it with the hope that someone reading this might be persuaded to temporarily ignore the John Birch Society atmosphere its conclusions engender. I believe it holds the key to certain geostrategic facts which an astute reader will infer, although they are too difficult to describe in a short book review.Golitsyn is an important and controversial defector (1961). This book, however, allegedly provides evidence of his profound paranoia that his critics argue ultimately misled such officers as James Angleton at CIA counterintelligence and inflicted great harm on US national security. This may be true, and Golitsyn's conclusions here are unfalsifiable, but the fact is this is not the book a madman would write, and at least on that basis its propositions ought to be considered seriously if for no other reason than that he is a genuine defector who provided much valuable information to the CIA.His main thesis is that after Stalin (d. 1953), and the German, Polish, and Hungarian revolts (last 1956), the Soviet state faced a profound destabilization. Stalin's power monopoly within the party was so complete there was a succession crisis following his death; his methods were so brutal re the newly created Soviet satellites that the populations took the opportunity of his death to revolt. Tito's rejection of Stalinism and Moscow's friction with Mao in particular also demonstrated dangers posed to the new Communist bloc's strategy of promoting revolution in the West and elsewhere. Lastly, and perhaps most urgently, the Soviet Union determined export by revolution through military means could never be accomplished in light of the advent of nuclear weapons and the West's determination (NATO, etc.) to unite against a united Communist bloc.Golitsyn contends that these problems were all resolved by the time of several party congresses held in 1959-1960, when he was a major in the KGB's strategic development department. The strategy adopted was one of profound subversion: instead of military confrontation by a united Bloc as the main weapon, the Soviet Union and its satellite governments agreed, while maintaining a credible military deterrent, to project an image of internal disunity while dedicating all its intelligence apparatus - many many times the size of the CIA and utterly unbound by laws or human rights considerations - to subverting the West. By pursuing this project over a long period of time - decades - the West would be oblivious to it, since its political horizon is the 4 or 6 year election cycle of a republic. Moreover, this type of thinking is simply alien to a West bound deeply to its own national traditions. The Politburo, however, was not bound by elections, and its leaders could be in power for a generation or more. The Soviet/Bloc time horizon was therefore very much wider.The purpose was this: by projecting an image of disunity and various fractures, the West was expected to relax its unified resistance to Communist advancement, and revert to its natural disunity along lines of national interest. This was of course a reasonable inference; the history of the West demonstrates it consistently. But there was a specific Soviet precedent to follow: Lenin's New Economic Policy following the Russian Civil War (1918-21). Lenin adopted this policy in order to reduce foreign hostility to Communist revolution; instead he projected an image of Russia embroiled in its own problems, that its force as a revolution-exporter was therefore spent, and in fact the country - having undergone WWI, the Revolution, and then the bloody Civil War - was starving. This last was in fact true - and Western powers, especially the USA, responded by sending massive food and material aid to the new Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks, whose power was inherently shakey following these events, used this food and material not to save all the starving people but to shore up its own base of support and consolidate its power. The Cheka - Soviet secret police - used the opportunity of many foreigners on its soil to infiltrate the aid organizations and to study the motives of its members, and then infiltrate the home societies. By 1923, the Bolsheviks were again attempting revolution in Germany, although that revolution failed.Golitsyn contends that the strategy adopted in 1959-1960 is essentially this same strategy, but on a scale commensurate with the new reality of a huge new Soviet bloc.This is just the basic thesis, and frankly it seems pretty plausible. The implications of the strategy are rather shocking, and this review is already too long, but given that the new Russia IS run by the KGB and there WAS NOT any de-Commmunisation - the same people (Yakovlev, Primakov, etc.) - are still in power, doesn't it stretch credulity to believe these people suddenly became non-Communists, in their 50th and 60th years, suddenly and irreversibly, over a couple days in 1991? I mean, c'mon, doesn't it? In any case, a fascinating, fascinating book. In light of the rather plausible case Golitsyn makes here, I think his critics protest too much - at least a little too much. Highly recommended, even if it is wrong."

B0006DEB1K,Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series),,A13XK1XROK2Y1K,Dean M. Jackson,6/7,5.0,1306972800,Best Laid Plans,"Why are the bureaucracies in the former USSR and the East Bloc still run by Communists (90% in the case of the Russian Federal government)?Why was there no decommunization program after the collapse of the USSR to ferret out Communist agents still in positions of power?Where were the `crimes against humanity' trials in Russia of Communist criminals after the collapse of the USSR?Why are KGB/GRU officers from the 1970s and 1980s in control of the major businesses in Russia?Why are the electorates of the fifteen republics that made up the USSR continuing to elect (since 1992) to the top executive offices in their respective countries persons who were Communists before 1990?Why do intelligence officers from Russia still defect to the West? Other than from Russia, when has an intelligence officer from a democracy ever defected to another democracy? Never, because such behavior would be oxymoronic.Though published in 1984, New Lies for Old allows us to answer these disturbing `post USSR' questions for ourselves. Defecting in 1961, KGB Major Anatoliy Golitsyn informed his CIA interrogators that in 1960 all Communist nations had signed onto a new strategy to defeat the West. Called the `Long-Range Policy' (research on the policy beginning in 1958), the purpose for the policy was to repair Stalin's mucking up the Communists' goal of world domination. Thanks to Stalin's strategic incompetence, Western nations formed defense pacts to counter Communism (NATO, SEATO, ANZUS, and CENTO). After the death of Stalin the Communists decided that a much more subtle strategy was needed if Communism was to prevail.Golitsyn writes:""The dangers of Stalinism to the communist movement were ignored or overlooked in the 1930s and 1940s because of the threat of fascism and the opportunities that it provided for the formation of popular fronts with socialist parties in the 1930s and for the forging of the wartime alliance with the Western powers. But by 1953-56, the damage Stalinism had done to the communist cause was apparent. It could be seen in the following:* The distortion, degradation, and discrediting of communist ideology. The image of Marxism as a philosophy had been tarnished in the eyes of Western intellectuals.* Deepening discontent in the Soviet Union and its satellites, leading to explosive revolutionary situations in East Germany, Poland, and Hungary.* The decline of communist influence and the isolation of communist parties and regimes.* The revulsion against Stahnist communism of Western liberals who had earlier been sympathetic.* The increased influence and prestige of anticommunism.* Strong opposition from various religious movements, including Catholicism and Islam.* The formation of Western military alliances, such as NATO, SEATO, and the Bagdad pact (later CENTO).* Hostility from moderate, genuinely nonaligned national leaders of the developing countries, such as Nehru.* Cooperation between Western democratic governments and anticommunist emigre organizations.* Collaboration between social democratic and conservative governments and parties against the Soviet threat.* Yugoslavia's break with the communist bloc and rapprochement with the West in the period 1948-55.* The serious tensions between the Soviet Union and Communist China, which threatened to create a split between them in 1950-53.* Zhdanov's opposition to Stalin.* The major power struggle in the Soviet leadership that followed Stalin's death.""The balance of New Lies for Old covers the eight disinformation operations (as Golitsyn counts them by 1984) under the new `Long-Range Policy', such as the fraudulent Sino-Soviet Split, and Communist play-acting that led Western analysts to mistakenly conclude that `power struggles' existed within Soviet, Chinese, and other Communist governments.Golitsyn not only warned the West about the `Long-Range Policy', but also used his in-side knowledge to predict with an amazing degree of accuracy future USSR/East Bloc behavior. Author Mark Riebling in his 1994 book 'Wedge: From Pearl Harbor to 9/11: How The Secret War Between The FBI And CIA Has Endangered National Security' credits Golitsyn with a whopping 94% accuracy rate in predicting Communist moves.As mentioned above, New Lies for Old was published seven years before the `collapse' of the USSR, so one might inquire if the `collapse' of the USSR was a strategic ruse, why does the West remain silent on it? Why doesn't the West alert its populations to the deception?The West pretends that the collapse of the USSR was genuine due to the interplay of two factors: (1) business pressures exerted on political parties to allow for trade with the `former' USSR/East Bloc, and (2) the intense need of political parties for business largesse in the form of campaign contributions. Businesses want to do business in the `former' USSR/East Bloc and political parties need money for elections. The intense competition for election money ensures that our political leaders remain silent on the Soviet ruse, while quietly engaging the USSR (witness the United States' current attempt to place a missile shield in Eastern Europe, which would, according to Russian generals, neutralize Russia's strategic nuclear forces).Will The United States' `compromised strategy' against the Communist world work? Or will the Communists' `Long-Range Policy' prevail? Since the Communists' `Long-Range Policy' has now been revealed, the Communists' strategy will fail if enough people are made aware of it. That means you, reader, must do your duty and play the role of Paul Revere!Addendum:One might also query why `former' East Bloc nations would agree to house NATO's missile shield inside their territories considering those governments are still Communist? My answer to that question is NATO believes that the leaders of those countries are no longer enthralled by the `Long-Range Policy', preferring `backdoor largesse' from the West. NATO's belief is a mistake in my estimation, and the mistake will become apparent to NATO when the affected East Bloc nations decide not to house NATO's missile shield just before it is to become operational (wasting tens of billions of dollars), which is expected to be in 2015. Watch to see if this prediction materializes.My analysis that NATO's missile shield will be cancelled at the last hour would explain nicely (for the official explanation is simply ludicrous) the April 10, 2010 crash in Smolensk, Russia of the Polish President's plane, reportedly killing the President and the top echelon of the Polish government. The crash, in my opinion, was a Communist intelligence operation, the purpose of which was to cement in the minds of the West that the Polish government was seen by Russia as a threat to the `Long-Range Policy' through its willingness to host the NATO missile shield. Needless to say, in this scenario the Polish President and entourage are still alive.Another major event to occur under the `Long-Range Policy' involves China. Watch for the Chinese Communist government to `collapse' due to a manufactured economic crisis in several years (circa 2015). This prediction comes from Golitsyn's second book published in 1995, The Perestroika Deception. In it Golitsyn says about China on page 166:""A campaign for a new system of World Government will be launched at Summit level and will be accompanied by pressure from below, the active use of agents of influence and secret assassinations of leaders who are seen as obstacles. The campaign will come as a surprise to the US Administration. In the ensuing negotiations, the US President of the day will find himself facing a combined pressure from the Russians and the Chinese. The Chinese will by then have adopted a `reformed', pseudo-democratic system.""So, according to Golitsyn, the new democratic government to arise in China will be controlled by the Communists from behind the scenes.If Golitsyn's analysis on China comes to pass then watch Mexico. Contemporaneous with the change in governments in China, the so-called `drug wars' will have spread throughout Mexico. Watch to see who Mexico asks for assistance in combating the `drug wars' there: China!"

Southworth,3/4,3.0,1292284800,New Lies for Old by Anatoliy Golitsyn,"Back in the 1960s and early 1970s, a bitter power struggle was taking place inside the CIA, between those in favour of detente with the Soviet Union and those who opposed it, with James Angleton, the director of Counterintelligence, a prominent figure among the latter. At the centre of the controversy was the author of this book, a KGB defector who claimed the existence of a communist masterplan, based on the use of disinformation to deceive the West into lowering it's guard.The principal objections to such a concept are fairly obvious, for example the levels of control and discipline needed to manipulate thousands of people into performing their individual roles in the overall plan, and the problem of keeping the whole operation secret. Nor is it clear what motivated Golitsyn to make these claims. But that does'nt mean we can dismiss them out of hand. Golitsyn's explanations of various different forms and objectives of disinformation are lucid enough to make the reader suspect that, much of the time, he is quoting from KGB documents. This in itself makes the book worth a look. In general he is less successful in his attempts to relate the theory of disinformation to practical and historical example, although I would'nt dispute that Soviet attempts to spread disinformation and propaganda on nuclear issues during the early 1980s were both extensive and well organised.Page 95 contains the interesting statement that ""the identities of secret agents who for one reason or another are reaching the end of their usefulness to the communist side may be given away through a source in whom the communist side is seeking to establish Western confidence"". It was of course Golitsyn who finally exposed Angleton's former colleague, Kim Philby, as a Soviet agent.Not a great book, but an interesting historical document."

The entire Warsaw pact is now a part of NATO, including the three Baltic States, which were part of the Soviet Union. The U.S. is very popular in that part of the world. There are U.S. military forces in former Soviet repuplics in the south. Some of these new allies are now getting American military equipment. The former Warsaw pact nations ARE democracies and are becoming culturally and economically integrated with the West. All of the dirty laundry of the Soviet ""Potemkin Village"" has been exposed to the world. The Iron Curtain is no more. Paul McCarney did a rock concert in Red Square that filled the joint with more people than Stalin ever could. The U.S. still has at least six thousand nuclear warheads (It would only take a few dozen to blow Russia into the middle ages). The Russian army has a tough time controlling Chechnya. Many of its troops were having problems getting paid and feeding their families. The former Soviet Navy is rusting in ports.The idea that this is all a conspiracy to lull the West to sleep is far fetched. What kind of nuts in the KGB could think that such a series of events would strengthen the position of the former Soviet Union.It is true that Russia is a threat. It is a quasi fascist hybrid that is becoming more fascist every day and probably will result in a resumption of the Cold war some day, but they will be weaker this time around. This is a natural part of Russian paranoia and their preference for authoritarianism, not a part of some old plot hatched in the Kremlin decades ago.Conspiracy theories break down because they presume that the conspirators have total control of very complex events. They ignore the fact that ""stuff happens"" to the best plans of mice and men. The more grandiose the conspiracy, the less likely it is to succeed.There are certainly conspiracies. But only the smallest ones have a chance to succeed.Frankly, the real problem is China. Every time we buy something at WalMart or Best Buys or you name it, we are funding the Chinese military industrial complex. What do we buy from Russia except Vodka? ""When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will sell us the rope""..Vladimir I. Lenin. Intel is building the most advanced micro-electronics plant in the world..in China. China has 1.6 billion people.The Chinese factor affects Russia too.

Michael,6/21,4.0,1164931200,Time has proven Golitsyn wrong,"Back in the late 1980s and early 90s when the Eastern Bloc was liberating itself and the Soviet Union was collapsing, Anatoliy Golitsyn's thesis that perestroika and glasnost were just a communist-orchestrated plot to lull the West into a false sense of security had more than an aura of plausibility, especially to those segments of the Right which saw conspiracies behind every world event. After all, the Soviets were the world's masters of deception and had even attempted something similar in the 1920s with the NEP, which the West responded to with all sorts of favors and aid. It also seemed highly unlikely that the Soviets just woke up one day and decided to give up their goal of world domination. There just had to be something sinister behind the whole thing.However, 15 long, transformative years have now passed since the end of the Soviet Union. It seems almost impossible that there is some hardline Soviet leadership cabal pulling the strings behind the scenes in the Kremlin, just waiting for the right moment to unfurl the hammer and sickle and re-establish the USSR. Too much water has gone under the bridge for that to happen. The Republics and the satellites are independent, democratic nations. The Russian people are used to capitalism, free speech and multi-party government. The conspiracy theorists make way too much of throwaway stories about Putin's positive comments about some aspects of the USSR, or some Russians' nostalgia for Stalin, etc. Russia may be an imperfect democracy by American standards, but it is a democracy nonetheless and unlikely to change. Golitsyn has been proven wrong, and the conspiracy theorists should accept it and move on. However, I know they'll still be citing this book in the year 2099, awaiting the imminent return of the Soviets, in league with the Jesuits, the Freemasons and the Illuminati."

My 3 year old son listens to them most nights before bed. It is amazing what he takes away from them - not least of which is a deep abiding faith. One day, while playing baseball, he lost his ball. I was in the garden and had no idea where it went. He looked and looked and couldn't find it. I was amazed to see him then get on his knees and pray - ""God, please help me find my baseball"". Unbelievable as it may be, within seconds, he found his ball. One mightthink that is a small, silly thing BUT it is one of many things that has had a profound, positive impact on my son's belief in God. My only negative comment is that if the stories are read to the very young, such as my son, the reader needs to carefully select as some of the stories illustrate rather graphically, severe consequences. My final comment is that one of the previous reviewer's complained about the Christian doctrine in the book. True. It is Christian. I too get upset by the harsh tone of some of the doctrine - however - the book is intended for bedtime as is stated in the title. Since I don't know of too many public schools where children sleep, I am not overly concerned. I believe the positive values of honesty, self-reliance, obedience and earnestness far outweigh the occasional lapses into harsh Christian doctrine."

I know that the author meant well, but as a very young boy many of them were disturbingly scary and horrifying.For example, the ""A mother's love"" theme. In one story, a mountain climber is buried under untold tons of rock from a landslide. His mother steadfastly stands by for as long as it takes workers to uncover his body from the huge pile of rubble. And by the end of the story, the workers had hardly made a dent in that pile of rubble. The message was supposed to show the steadfast dedication of a mother. But for me, I had nightmares about being buried alive with no hope of timely rescue for many years afterwords.In another story on this theme, we read about a dirt-poor mother with a sick baby, a cat, and a lone oil lamp to provide light. She leaves her house to get medicine for her sick baby, but leaves the baby, cat, and oil lamp behind. (She'd be charged with child neglect today, but Uncle Arthur thought of her as devoted and loving.) The cat, of course, knocks over the lamp and starts the house ablaze. The mother returns to see her home a blazing inferno. Her love gives her the strength to push the firemen aside and rush into the house. Her body was found wrapped lovingly around her baby, but both had burned to death in the blaze.There are others that try to illustrate love, dedication, and devotion but for me they only caused horrific and recurring nightmares for years afterword. I dimly recall many other stories that were indeed uplifting and educational. But beware. Tales of burning to death in a blazing fire, being crushed to death under tons of jagged boulders, and other horrific scenarios might very well illuminate the moral for an adult. However, impressionable young children with active imaginations might find them illuminating their deepest and most horrifying fears instead."

The you need these books. They are a refreshing breath of fresh air in an area where the mass media teaches parents to be freinds instead of parents. Backbone values like telling the truth, kindness, hard work, obedience to parents, turning the other cheek, timeliness, respect for authority, faith in God, and kindness to animals, humility, responsibility and honor are taught through real life stories. My kids still beg to be read these stories. I didn't think they had that much effect until I overheard them planning to do a ""secret package company"" (do a good deed for somebody in need anonymously) and to react to a nasty kid at school by ""heaping coals of fire onto him"". (being sincerely nice to him anyway) Boy was I proud...Two caveats: These were written in the thirties. The politically ""correct"" may not like some of the generalizations that were the norm in the day these were written. (Didn't bother me - I explained this to the kids) Second, these are real stories, not ""superheros"" or purple dinosaurs. The stories are of everday life. They reflect reality.

The Bedtime Stories never gave me nightmares, but it is true that some of the harsher aspects of life were dealt with -- abusive parents, death and dying, danger, war, poverty, loss. They were written in the days before ""political correctness"" was a watchword, and parenting was harsher even in good families. The stories are basically Victorian in tone -- emotional, intense, and disciplined. Uncle Arthur was a peer of my grandparents' generation and the way he speaks and the stories he tells and the conclusions he draws show him to be a man of his time, as well as a man of his particular belief system. Place him in context, and the way he tells his stories is appropriate.As a child, I liked his stories because they were about real people in real life crises, just like the real life happening around me. Through it all, there was the belief that the characters were not alone in their trials. His characters were interesting little people who weren't a bit perfect, but who still learned and grew and became better people. He taught that life wasn't easy but that prayer could get you through.Some Bedtimes Stories have stuck with me to the point that I recall their titles:Unlucky Jim -- A poor boy has a chance to choose a Christmas gift for himself, and is laughed at when he chooses a doll for his sick sister instead of the train that he wants.Teresina -- Two girls give up their beloved doll to a girl they dislike after she save their baby brother from being run over by a car.Through Fire and Water -- A brother and sister, left home alone, quarrel over a train set until they accidentally set the house on fire. The boy rethinks his relationship with his sister after she courageously fights the flames.Brave Bella -- Bella didn't want to babysit, but performs an act of heroism when her baby brother's carriage is ripped out of her hands on a windy jetty.As you can see by the descriptions, one has to look at these stories in the time frame in which they were written. Children were sometimes home alone, or out on their own, faced with decisions that an adult should have taken care of, but their belief in God helped them find their way to the better choice. That was always the underlying message in Maxwell's writings -- that through prayer, one can find the way.Debra Anne Wintsmith, Author of Precious Jewels, A Seventh-Day Adventist Family Saga"

Of course she returns with a broken arm and the son carries the guilt the rest of his life.In a third story, a woman calls a little girl an ungrateful wretch and swears to never give a child a gift again because Gertie forgets to thank her for the candy she bought.

I'm particularly concerned by Maxwell's apparent belief (implied in a story about a broken radio) that one cannot be a good person if one is not a practising Christian. Also in the same story he tells his young audience that Jesus would ""have to get rid"" of those who had not opened their hearts to him. I take this to mean that those who are not Christians are doomed to hell. I realize that this is religious doctrine and that the stories were written with a certain audience in mind, but all the same I would not feel comfortable knowing that this book was being used in my child's school (particularly in a city as diverse as Toronto.)

Venturing deeper and deeper into the jungle, Victor feels as though he is traveling farther and farther into history and farther away from his chaotic life of New York City. The simplistic and peaceful lives of the many tribes he finds deep in the jungle, and their beautiful musical instruments and primitive beats, cause for deep thought in Victor because of the almost overwhelming difference between the world he finds himself in and the world of the United States.

He rarely sees his wife, an actress, because they both have busy schedules that seldom coincide. One day a fated encounter with a museum curator he knew in his youth leads him to a mission into the jungle to find and bring back the most primitive of musical instruments and to gain anthropological insights on the origins of music. The musician, who begins the trip with his mistress, ends up on his own cut off from civilization. In the jungle he at last able to find an inner peace and happiness, he finds a new woman, regains his health &amp; vigor and at last is able to release the musical score he has always known was inside him.

The original plan of taking the money and his lover and defrauding the university so that they could enjoy an extended holiday in South America goes badly wrong when they unexpectedly get caught up in a revolution there and are forced into the jungle. Travelling at first with his mistress from New York and then with a mestizzo lover taken up along the way, the book describes in wonderful Baroque prose the awesome scale and sense of time reversal that he experiences in his dark, dripping travels into a world of perpetual greenness. He senses that he is retracing the steps of humanity. Finally, deep in the jungle he is faced with having to make an almost mystical choice about his life and life work. The `simple' life is uncompromisingly portrayed in its pitiless and raw brutality and yet somehow the `noble savage' still retains the essence of humanity, a survivor in the natural world stripped of the worthless accoutrements and gadgets of modern life. This is at once adventure, allegory, love story, morality tale, and academic tract, but above all it is storytelling at its majestic best, a minor masterpiece of post-war literature.Carpentier was the first writer to coin the phrase `magical realism' where myths, fables and religion are interwoven into narratives without faithful adherence to time or reality. The form is taken to its extreme in Garcia Marquez's Autumn of the Patriarch, and these two authors remain magical realism's most accomplished exponents. Although the style has influenced writers worldwide, for me it doesn't seem to work beyond Latin America."

Fickling,1/1,5.0,1252886400,A Latin America novel of incredible richness,"Probably the most remarkable literary event of the 20th century was the explosion--no other word will suffice--of Latin American literary creativity, fully comparable to a similar explosion in the US in the 19th century. And one of the most remarkable creators of this explosion is Alejo Carpentier. Reasonable people may differ regarding who is the greatest Latin American novelist, but surely Carpentier must be ranked among them, and ""The Lost Steps"" is his most widely read work.The plot of ""The Lost Steps"" can be summarized very simply. The narrator, a naturalized American citizen living in New York City, once had youthful ambitions to become a composer. However, he now finds himself earning a living doing musical hack work, e.g., jingles for TV commercials. He is married and also has a mistress. When the novel opens, he has not had any work commissioned in a while and is starting to feel desperate. A friend who is a museum curator offers him the opportunity to go to an unnamed South American country to find a rare musical instrument. The narrator cynically sees this as an opportunity to have an expenses-paid trip with his mistress, but as the trip progresses he feels his dormant musical creativity being revived. He eventually finds the instrument he is looking for. He also meets a primitive, illiterate, mixed-race young woman by whom he is initially repulsed but with whom he eventually falls in love and cohabits with. His mistress leaves him and goes back home. He ends up living with his mistress in a small, inaccessible village deep in the jungle; the only other inhabitants are a native tribe and a few merchants of European descent. He believes that he has now found true happiness, away from the corruption and decadence of modern civilization. He forgets all about his obligations to the museum that sponsored his trip and vows never to go back.One day his idyllic bliss is shattered when a helicopter lands and he learns that his ""disappearance"" has become front page news in the US. His wife and his museum sponsors have sent a search party to look for him. He realizes that he has no choice but to go back, although he desperately wants to stay. He promises his native lover that he will be back as soon as he can. When he gets back home, he discovers that he has become a celebrity, at least for a while, but he is miserably unhappy. His pregnant wife files for divorce, and the newspaper that sponsored his rescue now regards him as a traitor and deceiver and portrays him in the most negative light possible. His sources of income dwindle. He is reunited with his mistress but is repulsed by her and wants desperately to return to the village.Nearly a year passes before he is able to attempt to get back to the remote village. Getting there involves a water passage, and he finds to his horror that the rains that have fallen in recent months have caused the water level to rise to the point that the river covers the steps that were his marker for the jungle path to the village. He has no way to return to the village! Shortly thereafter he learns from someone who occasionally visits the village that his primitive lover has married someone else in the village. He is devastated. He suddenly realizes that he was never accepted by the people of the village or by his lover, that he was always regarded as an outsider who was only there temporarily and would never stay. Reluctantly, he decides to return to New York, realizing that he has no other choice.This simple synopsis does not to justice to the richness of this novel. Even in translation, the richness of Carpentier's prose comes through: his fluency with words, his mastery of sentence structure, his mastery of metaphor and allegory. This is a novel of immense erudition, replete with literary and musical references. One of the novels messages, I think, is to enjoy and savor the peak experiences of life when you can, because they won't last and they won't come back again. Another message is that perfect happiness is unattainable and that most humans need to be content with what they are able to attain. In short, this is a work of incomparable richness that I can recommend unreservedly."

It is very important that we not confuse the narrator with the author. One of the author's many messages is that this kind of return to one's roots is impossible. The author subtly makes fun of his narrator to illustrate this. The tragedy of the book is that there is no escape for us into another culture, flawed as our culture may be.May I say that I was assigned to read this book in a comparative literature course at Berkeley over thirty years ago, but managed to avoid getting any more than the most superficial impression of it. But, hey; those were the sixties!My professor thought that this was an outstanding example of 20th century Latin-American literature, and I believe it is considered a classic.

There were times when I wanted to put the book down because the narrator becomes so tedious. But I completely feel that it was worth it. By the end, I cared about the characters and felt that I had accompanied the narrator on his spiritual journey. I loved it and might actually read it again in the future. (I am not going to make specific comments on the novel's content because it seems that other reviewers have already taken care of that task)In response to some reviewers who had a problem with ""pretentious"" or ""jaded"" discourse of the narrator, I believe that this novel would not have the same meaning without such a narrator. He is constantly thinking that he has found the key to life or a secret to solving all of his problems--principally by returning to a simpler life--, but the narration shows his complete inability to do that (even when he thinks that he has). In the end of the novel he addresses this, saying that such a simple life (i.e. the prehistoric, Enochian time period of Santa M&oacute;nica de los Venados) is not meant to be intellectualized but rather experienced. The narrator is incapable of this kind of life, and his world view often clashes with it. If the narration were less complex, this truth would be less apparent, as it would not achieve such a stark contrast with the simplicity of its surroundings.Also, another note about the style: This novel was written in Spanish. In Spanish, the concept of a run-on sentence does not exist and Carpentier exploits this. If you don't like run-on sentences or intellectual ""Baroque"" style narration, then this may not be the book for you.Favorite quotes (if nothing else, Carpentier's phrases are beautiful when he's not filling them when obscure references):""Un d&iacute;a, los hombres descubrir&aacute;n un alfabeto en los ojos de las calcedonias, en los pardos terciopelos de la falena, y entonces se sabr&aacute; con asombro que cada caracol manchado era, desde siempre, un poema.""""Casarse es caer bajo el peso de leyes que hicieron los hombres y no las mujures"" (especially after I had found the narrator horribly sexist)"

Different time, different book, different language, different continent... only the ignorant could conflate them. The Lost Steps is not a hypocritical, pretentious condemnation of pretention. It is a condemnation of the sort of empty commercialized work that prevents one narrator from finding his voice as an artist. The Lost Steps is the story of a hispanic musician/intellectual who lives in the modern city (sounds like New York to me) and makes a living writing jingles for commercials. He has the opportunity to make a long journey to a very different place in Latin America. The journey liberates him creatively so that he is able to find his &quot;voice&quot; as a musical artist. Not a bad story. As for the complaint that the narrator's language is riddled with words and metaphors from music should not trouble us when we consider that the narrator is a highly trained musician. Artists frame the world around them in the language of their craft. There was a time - not more than 60 years ago, in fact)when everyone who was &quot;educated&quot; could at least read a little sheet music and play a little bit of piano and those funny Italian terms that today sound like a foreign language were once understood by most everyone. The ignorance of today's readers is no basis for condemning the author as &quot;pretentious&quot;. What I liked most about this story were those moments of brilliant prose where the narrator's (and the author's) love for Latin America shines through. The narrator's journey portrays Latin America in terms of &quot;Lo Real Maravilloso&quot;, the marvelous reality where 20,000 years of human history have been superimposed and condensed within a single geographic space, making that space a unique place distinct from all other geographic spaces. If you are fascinated by &quot;Lo real maravilloso&quot; of Latin America, its cultures, its history, and you like stories about narrators who seek and find their artisitic voice (an over-used plot, perhaps) this is an enjoyable read. And no, you don't need to be a classically trained musician to appreciate this book!"
B0006BRDX0,The lost steps,,A39YYVPTPP4YJ0,"N. K. Kordatzis ""Christina de Gand""",5/8,3.0,1237680000,Great descriptions but pretentious in it's style,"I have very mixed feelings about this novel.Before anything else I must say that the writer has an extraordinary use of the Spanish language.What is most attractive are his descriptions, however his constant use of citations in French,German and English become somewhat tiresome (I do speak the languages)together with the endless citing of works of Art or Historical events. I cannot help but find it pretentious.Then we have the part were he describes the good woman of old - always there to serve the husband and attend to his slightest whish - is this machismo or not!!Unable to live any further in a society he despises ,he travels to the place where everything in still pure and noble, he is totally taken in by it and falls in love with a local woman.However he treats his lover like a piece of dirt, making love to the other when she lies half death in her hamac.She is not the perfect companion but a human being nevertheless.Much as I try I am unable to like the speaker in the book.So I find myself with the dilemma that I like his writing but probably not the way he thinks. So I give three stars which are very much deserved but cannot give more if I want to be honest with myself."
B0006BRDX0,The lost steps,,A3OJ012QPTGMLR,R. J MOSS,12/21,3.0,1131840000,Following Jaded Footsteps,"I first heard of,'Lost Steps' about the time of its author's death in 1980 and ticked it off for a future reading that has waited more than two and a half decades. It's a big prize winner, carrying cult status. But these attributes notwithstanding, I found it too ponderous to raise an hurrah.Latin American 'magic realsim', I suggest, was more of a novelty when,'Lost Steps' made its mark. Jaded bougeoise seeks to revamp his creative energies in Amazonian jungle by contact with 'primitive' indians, their instruments and culture. Within the text the narrator flags that this surrealist motive had wearied during its halcyon days of the 20s and 30s. More than once Rene Daumal's,'Mt Analogue' sprang to mind with similar 'deep' pronoucements and promises of and from an enchanted world. One could say the piling of metaphor upon metaphor entirely expresses the fecudity of tropical forests or the baroque tendencies of an angst-ridden, fatigued intellectual. But why don't these similar excesses beleaguer Cormac McCarthy's great,'Blood Meridian'? Is it that McCarthy's sensibilities are closer to ours and that for all his biblical portent, he is more open to the aesthetic and moral disorder that we inhabit? Carpentier refuses to drop his moral superiority during brilliant reveries of geology, birds, music, and whatever. And he doesn't like 'back there' in the city. For me, the battle wasn't with the musical erudition but the canopy of hyperbole that shaded too much of the ground life. The action was sluggish, and the presumtions that the reader might be enlightened by strings of proper nouns that lack explanatory power, a trifle too demanding. Perhaps the narrator's prayer for a poetry of the city equal to that of an Amazonian snail shell was answered within a few years by Bobby Rauschenberg's art. He ferreted stuff from New York's gutters and junkshops to make a gregarious art that would stupify Carpentier's stuffy, opinionated narrator and render those earlier Surrealists' excursions into the second hand as so much preciousness."

Whether read as an adventure story into the cultural roots of humanity in Latin America or as an adventure into rich, literary symbolism, Alejo Carpentier's masterpiece is a work that can be read again and again.Carpentier's ability as a skilled craftsman in the art of writing comes through whether he describes a journey over the Andes, a revolution, or the barking of dogs in a Indian village.Harriet de Onis has provided us with an incomparable translation from Spanish to English of this work of art. In my opinion it is the BEST work of fiction of the 20th Century. Test it for yourself."

In both books the self-destructive main character sort of moves from fascinating episode to episode, while the overall plots are seemingly not that relevant. In both books, these episodes take place in exotic, vividly described Latin locales. Also, in both books, there is bunches of deep philosophizing and erudition, which don?t make for the easiest reading around.All in all, I enjoyed ""Lost Steps"" as I enjoyed ""Under the Volcano"". Somehow I feel Lowry?s work is the greater. Perhaps the autobiographical tint in ""Lost Steps"" contributes to somewhat mundane finale. And some of the moments of philosopy do get grating. But this is still very good stuff, and I do recommend it for those inclined towards very serious fiction."

This book expects the reader to have a passing knowledge of Latin American geography, botany, zoology, religion, some classical music, some 20th century world history, some vocabulary.... well, it just expects you to be a literate reader. You know, the kind of person that would read The New Yorker instead of Seventeen.This, to me, is the most fascinating thing about ""Pasos Perdidos/The Lost Steps,"" in that it challenges the reader to apply everything that he or she might have learned along the way in life, and get a thrill from doing so.Carpentier is one of the neobaroque writers who explore how the Latin American landscape and political culture contribute an entire new aesthetic to the world heritage, taking certain elements from the Spanish baroque but hybridizing it in a new climate, with new indigenous elements to form a completely new style of baroque culture. The moment, for example, that the narrator begins composing his original score, is the moment that he emerges from the Roman Catholic Mass in which he has been baptized (previously he was a cultural Lutheran), and gazes upon the liana vines hanging from the trees, and remembers strains of a Palestrina counterpoint. This fusion of American landscape, Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation ideology of incarnation and European aesthetic heritage is what (in)forms the American Baroque for Carpentier.Yeah, I love a good excuse to be ""pretentious"" myself, now and then. Thanks for the opportunity! :D"

Some people write books out of passion or a desire to express emotion. Carpentier, however, wrote this book simply for the purpose of writing literature. It is ironic that Carpentier spends much of his book ridiculing the pseudo-inetellectual community for their pretentions to greatness, while in fact he is the worst of them all. References to works of literature and music seem out of place and cited only to prove the author's familiarity with them. If you want a better treatment of the same theme, read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness instead. The Lost Steps is not worth touching with a ten foot pole."

Sure, there were sections that dealt with his childhood, but the most straightforward, poignant, and powerful poems were those that dealt with very mature topics: specifically, *after* he graduated from high school.Some of the poems, particularly those dealing with his friend Ben and the dissolution of his relationship, are very touching. Some are a little confusing, and I found myself backtracking to figure out who was being referred to in the poem, what the topic was, and its relevance in that particular place. Poetry, it seems, is intentionally misleading at times, and I find that to be an annoying characteristic.That said, I myself have a wealth of experiences from elementary, junior high, and high school that are ripe for writing, as they are devastatingly powerful. In my own writing classes and seminars, teachers have literally begged me to write about them, rather than the ""typical"" YA that I'm working on, which is more fantasy based. The problem was, I didn't know how to do it. I didn't want to write a straightforward story, because the format just didn't seem right.

The unifying factor is Hanna Malter, a young girl growing up in the small town of Burgdorf amidst a seemingly large and disparate cast of characters who in one way or another shape her childhood experiences. These stories tell of idiosyncracies, deformities, illegimacy, masochism, incest, dark premonitions, murder, suicide, madness, magic and healing, but in the most gentle, lyrical and dream like way possible, ie a million miles away from the cheap sensationalism common to purveyors of pulp fiction. Each story is complete in itself and without exception, beautifully told. Readers of this wonderful collection of vignettes is going to have his own personal favourites. Therein lies the fun - it's like choosing from a box of chocolates. There is a pervading sense of sadness in these tales which spring from the religious limitations and provincial-mindedness of a society on the fringe, but you're never conscious of it until it's over and you get the chance to reflect on it. Hegi's talent and integrity as a writer is self evident in the way she has achieved the near impossible, that of transforming characters with the makings of a grotesque into believable human beings. The result is a poetic and strangely uplifting novel that is a joy to read. Highly recommended."

The stories continue to flow seamlessly, through her whole book. Yes, ""stories,"" as even though the book is a novel, it is composed of chapters, which are in fact free standing stories in and of themselves. All the stories are narrated by her protagonist, but each story could be lifted out of the book, and be self-contained.Her subject of each story is unique, and yet it is all mixed with her wondrous elucidation of the struggles, feelings and progression of the German people in `reconstruction' after the World War II. The people left, in so many country towns of Germany, in the aftermath of the war. These people were only trying to live; before, during and after the war. They were not part of the political maelstrom we call National Socialism. Their lives were very much more simple than that, and they did suffer quite terribly, yet they stoically went on, as people have proved in every corner of the globe, that this is what human beings do. They pick up what is left and go on.Hegi does not concentrate on the effects of the war, they are coincident with the life that is found in post-World War II Germany. Hegi concentrates upon the life of her protagonist, a very smart and very sensitive young lady, from age 7 through about 14, as she grows up in this environment. The problems that she encounters though are the normal problems that all people encounter in every environment. Only the backdrop has to do with where they are and what the landscape is like. Hegi pays attention to that, but not overly, it is the people that are her subject: from Love to Death, from teenage pregnancy to sexual child abuse, from amputation to neural disease, these are the things that Hegi speaks about, and how they affect her narrator as she grows up in the midst of it. As she grows up in life, perhaps wherever she might be.Hegi writes modern day literature. It is worthy of the classification, and will endure the test of time. All readers who enjoy wonderfully written contemporary literature should not miss the opportunity to indulge themselves in Hegi's book."

Floating in my Mother's palm is a girl's (Hanna) recollection of different bits and pieces of her life before her other-than-conventional mother (Jutta) died in a small town (Burgdorf) in post WWII Germany. Through out the stories, Hanna recollects, you can see the guiding post of her mother at each important point.FLOATING.. IS THE FIRST OF TWO BOOKS, BUT IS SET LATER IN TIME. The second book is Stones from the River, which chronicles the life of Trudi Montag; a young dwarf woman that is one of the key characters in young Hanna's life. I would recommend reading &quot;Stones from the River&quot; prior to this book as it sets the stage for many of the characters in this book. However, these are differently constructed books. I found myself trying to link the facts (they were consistent) and found, I might be missing the point of the story. It's not the details but the interweaving of events that fashion a life. Stones from the River uses the details of a very different life to weave the story of Trudi Montag. Floating uses broader strokes to paint Hanna's tale.HANNA LIKE TRUDI, LEARNS FROM THE OUTSIDERS VIEWPOINT Hanna's unconventional mother Jutta is a painter and is close to her daughter in an different sense. She passes on to her daughter her &quot;unclouded&quot; view of people and society and with this Hanna experiences many different sides of the small town she grows up in. Trudi Montag, the town grape vine, also adds to this unique view as she is only too happy to provide Hanna with the knowledge of the town's darker side.A short book in comparison with Stones from the River, but one very complete in its own sense."

She makes their stories real and valid.It is an emotional book ~~ where her housekeeper's son finds out he's illegimate; where she watches her childhood friend raped by her grandfather give up the baby she had come to love; watches her neighbor in the apartment above them give himself to man after man who degrades him. And other stories as well.This is a book perfect for reading groups to read and to discuss ~~ there are lots of different stories in here and it's not written poorly like too many other books out there today.12-18-03"

I selected this book after reading &quot;Stones&quot; and &quot;Salt Dancers&quot;, and liked this one the best of all. Hegi's writing is tight, sparse, and clean in this &quot;novel&quot; and Hanna, the teller of the tales, (and the baby to whom Trudi from &quot;Stones&quot; was so attached), is a fine observer of the both the strengths and weaknesses of her fellow townspeople - yet she is sympathetic in her recounting of some personal and pivotal time in each person's life. I've wondered whether my enjoyment of this book stems from having met some of these characters from &quot;Stones&quot; - but I actually enjoyed this book more. &quot;Stones&quot; provided the broad narrative for several decades of history in their little German town while &quot;Floating in my Mother's Palm&quot; sheds light on the more personal stories of these characters.

Hegi is a master storyteller and gifted in her use of language to convey strong characters in memorable settings. Floating in My Mother's Palm is a first person account of the childhood of its main character, Hanna. As Hanna recounts aspects of her life that shaped her character and perspective, she introduces you to other characters in the town of Burgdorf and provides a view into their lives that make the town and its people real in every aspect. Each character is reminiscent of someone I've known from my own life. Its remarkable how the lives of characters from a small town in Germany can be so similar to those in Anytown, USA. The situations may be different but the issues are the same. Many of the characters in the novel appear in other work by Hegi, making the body of her work an intimate experience, leaving the reader feeling like they are getting closer and closer to each character with each novel read. Hegi's writing has never disappointed me."

There were many themes in the book, but only a couple stood out the most for me. Faith most definitely was a primary theme in this book. Faith came into place when Hanna's grandmother had a disease that spread throughout her body. It also came into place when Hanna's friend had polio in her leg. Hanna rubbed holy water on the little girl's leg that she had stolen from church. Both the girls believed and had faith that by doing this the little girl's leg would heal.Fear was also incorporated into this book. In took place in a one of the chapter's where a man by the name of Siegfried Tegern kept having a bad dream about dying. This fear compelled him to buy several dogs to protect him, which in the end, became his destruction."

Each neighbor--young or old-- somehow touches Hanna's life, unintentionally parting with a lesson, depositing a memory that makes up a childhood. The events unfold in Hegi's lyrical, mellifluous voice, rich with the texture of the people and smells of the place.Floating In My Mother's Palm is structured less in a novel format that in the form of interlinking short stories. Eventually, the characters that reappear in Hegi's stories become familiar with their physical traits and idiosyncrasies. Some, like Trudy the dwarf, populate Hegi's Stones From The River.Growing up in a loving home of a father who is the town's dentist and a mother who is an accomplished painter, Hannah the child observes life's tragedies as they happen to others, never to her, until her mother's premature death. Interestingly, this event, which is foreshadowed in the opening of the book, is skimmed over. Hannah indulges in memories of her remarkable mother, but the emotional devastation expected from the start of the book and supported by the tone of the other tragedies is curiously missing. Even the adult Hannah selects only two of her mother's paintings out of an atticful. When tragedy strikes Hannah, it is less impactful than those taking place in other households.Floating In My Mother's Palm is a beautifully told story that holds the reader's attention and never lets go.

While this is the first Ursula Hegi book I've read, it definitely won't be the last. This is a such a beautiful and brilliant collection of short stories. Most of the stories are told from the vantage point of Hanna Malter, a young girl whose mother is a painter and her father is a dentist, in post WWII Germany. They live in a small town, Burgdorf, about 30 minutes from Dusseldorf. All the stories are essentially character studies of various people from their village and the intertwined nature of their lives with the Malter's. There is not a bad story in this collection -- some are funny, some are disturbing, some are sad --- but all are wonderfully written and make you feel like a voyeur in this small town, learning all the hidden secrets of various people that permeate Hanna and her family's life.

The wade was worth it, each step through that current only strengthening me for the adventures of the stalwart German dwarf girl. Imagine my surprise--and joy!--when I discovered that Hegi's ""Floating in My Mother's Palm"" revisits the same area of Germany and the life of postwar Trudi.Hegi weaves her stories around a small town and its people, using Hanna as a reliable, sometimes young and innocent, sometimes wise narrator. Hanna's story jumps forward from the conclusion of ""Stones from the River,"" where she and Trudi had formed a strong bond. Here, though, we learn of a man who dreamed of his death, and in trying to stop it only perpetuated it. We discover the impetuous side of Hanna's otherwise dependable father. And we learn of Trudi's own romantic notions. While reading, I was reminded a number of times of Ray Bradbury's ""Dandelion Wine,"" except set in Germany.These are whimsical, magical, sometimes dark stories of one girl's childhood and those who shape her and her community.

1853996688,Spartacus (Ancients in Action),24.95,A33X6927EP7IHT,"Duncan L. Cooper ""Spartacus scholar""",5/5,5.0,1104883200,Finally Spartacus Enters The Non-Ficton Arena,"Theresa Urbainczyk's has written an admirable brief study, published by the venerable Gerald Duckworth and Co. Ltd, as an entry in their recent Ancients in Action series of short incisive books which ""introduces major figures of the ancient world to the general reader, including each subject's life, works, and significance for later western civilization.""A senior classics lecturer at University College Dublin who has previously been known for her works on the history of church and state under the late Roman Empire, Ms. Ubainczyk fills her publisher's prescription to a tee in this, her first work on slavery and slave rebellion under the late Republic. In it she offers an explanation of how a gladiator rebel against slavery from two thousand years ago who ultimately failed, was vilified by the establishment of his own time, and left no disciples or writings to carry on his ideas, still managed to become so influential in the modern era. She begins with a brief survey of the impact of Spartacus on such diverse historical phenomena as the French Revolution, the slave uprising under Toussant L'Overture in Haiti, the Italian Risorgimento under Garribaldi, the Marxist movement of the ninteenth century, the failed German revolution in 1918, and the communist regimes of the twentieth century. Stepping back into the Roman Republican period she leads the reader through the background of conquest, slavery, gladiatorial games, and previous slave rebellions that ultimately led to the great Italian servile war. What follows is an up-to-date account of the revolt of Spartacus, his rise, many victories, and final defeat by his arch enemy Marcus Licinius Crassus. Although writing for the general reader the author is not afraid to examine with a critical eye some of the heretofore accepted academic conclusions regarding Spartacus's aims, accomplishments, and potential for greater, more lasting success. The narrative section of the book concludes with a chapter on slaves and slave rebellions in the centuries following Spartacus's uprising which contains accounts of some little known episodes and even major military campaigns which are to be found in the surviving ancient historical texts.In the central chapter of the book the author illumines how despite the negative press Spartacus received from contemporary ancient historians, Plutarch, one of our main surviving sources on the slave rebellion, presented him in a positively heroic light in his Life of Crassus, thereby transforming him into a timeless hero. She presents an in-depth analysis of how Plutarch, in an attempt to express the anti-Roman and pro-Greek sentiments clearly evident in his accounts of other Greek and Roman lives, contrasted Spartacus's admirable moral and martial qualities with the far baser characteristic traits of his opponent, Crassus. While her arguments are certainly original and convincing, I would suggest that without the more sympathetic accounts of Plutarch's sources, the anti-establishment Roman historian Sallust, and perhaps the polymath genius and Stoic philosopher Posidonius, Plutarch's own near adulatory sketch of the career of Spartacus would not have been possible. But the brevity required for an introductory work for the general reader required that she dispense with the same kind of detailed treatment of their works that she accorded to Plutarch.The book then shifts to a consideration of the figure of Spartacus in the modern imagination, specifically of the three widely read English language novels about Spartacus published from 1930 to 1951 which are still in print, and of the Kirk Douglas film which stands today as the paradigm for Spartacus in the minds of people worldwide. In fairness to the reader, the author must confess that in her critical chapter on the film, Ms. Urbainczyk makes extensive use of the theme and content of his own essays on the dire role played by studio censorship in diluting the fundamental historical lesson which the filmmakers intended to convey: man's capacity in all ages to resist dehumanization. While gratified by her support of my own critique of the film in opposition to some professional historians who find nothing wrong with the image of the slave revolt which it offers, I would advise the reader judge her conclusions for himself.Overall this is a very accessible, interesting and eye-opening introduction to the subject that should leave the reader clamoring for more."

Like when she mentioned that his jumpsuit was black? WRONG. As every hardcore Myers fan should know, Michael's jumpsuit is navy blue. Not black(of course!) And the whole grunting, groaning, growling thing is a major flaw, because he was always silent and emotionless ever since he murdered his sister. And also, he wasn't as sneaky and silent as he was in the movies, it was almost like he was desperate to be seen. Besides that, this was a very good book with gruesome death scenes, good humor, and loads of action. I'm only 11, but trust me on this: This is the best in the three book series."

This course book has both clear and user-friendly grammar reference and a lot of interesting skill-building practices. It helps learners to practice grammar in controlled exercises and communicative tasks. The tasks are similar to what learners may encounters in real life, and some of them require oral negotiation during the problem-solving process. Thus, this material help learners to use English in carrying out tasks in real life. Unlike traditional structural-based and drill-focused grammar books, this material allows learners to practice and use grammar in a social context, so it is very suitable for EFL or ESL classrooms, but not for individual learning. The outstanding features of this grammar series are as follows: 1. The methodological emphasis on retrospective approach to grammar. For example, learners encounter the focused grammar structure (usually highlighted) in a reading passage or a dialogue in the first section. Then, they will read the explanation of that grammar usage in the second section. Examples are always included in the explanation, so it is easy to understand and remeber the grammar usage. 2. Instruction-friendly design: model dialogues or passage, explicit explanation of grammar, and ready-for-use tasks are provided 3.A good grammar companion to any other course book: units are arranged according to grammar categories, so learners can practice what they need. 4.Well-designed and interesting skill-building exercises. Some are task-based exercises and allow learners to practice grammar in real communication. 5. Focus on content. Wide-range of interesting subject matters in the presentation and practices. Usually, all ofthe exercises/tasks within one unit deal with the same grammar structure (e.g. passive voices)through the same content topic (e.g.naming) Sometimes, the topics of several units are related when these units deal with related grammar structures."

While FOG does give an in depth view into the grammar aspects of English, it does not do so in a concise manner, and I am surprised that no one has written this before. The presentation of the grammar aspects is done so in a confusing setting that, while it does present the material at least, does not do so in a manner beneficial to someone learning the language. There are tremendous amounts of errors in the book itself as well; this includes not only the editing itself but also the answer keys. I find I am often forced to skip exercises because they present contradictory material to the presentation given in the beginning of a chapter. Students who have studied English grammar intensively previous to using this book will find that they have a lot of questions that are difficult at best to answer. If you are stuck using only this series of books, good luck to you; you will be pulling your hair out time and time again if you, as well as your students, are paying attention to what is actually in the book and not just writing what &quot;feels&quot; right as a native speaker. There is a lot of confusing and almost false material presented. It seems as though the language was manipulated for publishing purposes, as opposed to using realistic language for organizing a lesson. And as far as communicative grammar goes, I find this is by far a &quot;workbook&quot; type of grammar book; though there are opportunities presented for communicative work, it is often not done so in a realistic setting."

Escher's most well known pieces, combined with a 16 pg scholarly overview by J. L. Lochner.I've always been a fan of Escher's art (as is true of many people with a somewhat scientific bent) - I enjoy the way he plays with the perceptions of the viewer ... with conflicting nuances of perspective, texture, color, outline, light, shadow, as well as with his studies of how to use the finite to evoke the infinite. In any case, this book was an opportunity to dive more deeply into the artist's varied works - not just his well know pieces, but also many of his lesser known ones.The author's introduction is very capable and illuminating (if a bit short) - taking the reader on a journey across the artist's career (including both his pre 1937 period in which he focused mainly on the Italian and Spanish countryside; and his post 1937 period, in which he focused increasingly on studies in perspective, metamorphosis, and the infinite), and illuminating aspects that many viewers miss out on ... such as the artist's incredible talent for spatial precision and fine etchmanship (most of Escher's works are carved, rather than drawn - something that's easy to miss out on if you've only seen pictures of the works, rather than the originals themselves).All in all, I found this book to be a very adequate, if unspectacular, introductory overview of Escher's works."

Meanwhile, her nights, with new husband Matt, are filled with the prosaic pressures of married life -- like where to live, or whether or not to have a baby.Tracy explores Nancy's life and background to a far greater degree in this novel. There are vignettes about Nancy's life as a youngster in Canada, of her time in London, and even about her unorthodox family in Trinidad.

It delivered on about half of those.The quasi-autobiography of Tracy Quan shares with the reader some of the problems a married call girl in New York faces. The core of problem, other than being a prostitute, is that her high profile banker husband doesn't know about her career. She has to live a double life, avoiding her husband and his family while maintaining her working relationships with fellow prostitutes and her customers. She masks her business by only making appointments in the day, checking her e-mail and voice mail only while she's alone, keeping her old apartment (while sub-letting it to another working girl) and pretending to be taking French classes. The funny thing is that her husband never really shows an interest in what she is doing during the day.There are lots of sex scenes. An I mean a lot of them. But other than that there's no real motive to the book. It comes off as bland and tasteless with no real emotional content to it. There are places that will cause a reader to chuckle, but there's nothing overly funny occurring.Which is a shame. A book about a woman that sells sex for a living and is good enough to live very well, but has to keep it a secret from her husband is full of potential. It could have explored the reasons behind choosing a life as a sex worker beyond the token excuse of a young girl running away from home. It could have been turned into a comical farce of the first order. Instead what the reader gets is Quan attempting to disguise her own life story behind a thin veil of fiction. It just doesn't work for me."

While most books show you complicated math expressions and equations to explain a rule, this book both explains it in an easy to understand way, and it shows it in simple and complex expressions and equations. It also walks you through some great examples for every section of every chapter. This book also has calculator views for all of the examples; this includes graphs and multi entry calculations. The Chapters are separated nicely and are in an appropriate order. On the inside cover and first and last page, are formulas, basic graphs, and many more basic mathematical concepts that students will learn (or have learned). This book also does a small chapter introducing some calculus concepts, which helps in the transition from Precalculus to Calculus.

It is good to see all the general backup principles laid down in writing and then discussed in relation to Veritas Netbackup.Myself, I am an expert with IBM Tivoli Storage Manger (ITSM/TSM/ADSM) and find the discussion of Veritas Netbackup good to know about.

Many of the concepts transcend NetBackup and can be applied in general.Chapter 10 does a nice job of exploring the future of backup approaches, offering insight into what we might expect to see in the coming years. As important, this book provides two appendices covering &quot;Disaster Recovering Planning&quot; (Appendix D) and &quot;Business Impact Analysis&quot; (Appendix E) which could pay for the book in their own right.This book should be a requirement for any organization which utilizes or is considering the use of NetBackup."

There is some good information here, but it seems a little too Politically Correct to my tastes. I have not seen a data center that actually operates as the book describes. Also, the author has a relationship with Veritas, so how many of Vertitas' shortcomings can we expect from a book like this? The entire manuscript would have to have passed through Veritas' legal and PR department before getting anywhere near the publisher. So much for getting the real story. As far as alternatives, if the reader is looking for corporate/unix information, Unix Backup and Recovery for UNIX is the way to go. For PC users, you can't beat How to Backup Your Windows Computer.

The authors thoroughly cover all of the issues associated with back-up and recovery, including those related to business continuity, disaster recovery, and the affect that back-up and recovery has on service and availability.Given the pervasiveness of both UNIX (including Linux), and Windows, I like the fact that both operating systems are addressed in the book. I am firmly in the UNIX camp, but it's nearly impossible to find a Linux or UNIX shop that doesn't have at least some critical applications running on Windows servers.Of course, if you use Netbackup this book is going to be all the more valuable; however, if you don't, do not let the fact that the authors base the concepts and examples on this product dissuade you from buying this book. It is one of the best books on back-up and recovery issues and challenges, regardless of vendor solution used."

The haiku are refreshing, often whimsical with a light touch of humor. A few thematize Zen (""Emptiness, no holiness, Bodhidharma's statue: Daffodils in the water"" p. 107), some thematize Buddhism more generally (""Buddha Nature, if compared, Must be this White bell-flower"" p.96), but most, while good, do kind of leave you wondering what is specifically ""Zen"" about them, but no matter. A real surprise though were the examples of Soseki's paintings and calligraphy; I knew he dabbled with watercolor painting but had little idea he was this accomplished in traditional East Asian art forms in this manner. These add a real nice touch to an artistically arranged book that can still fit in your pocket and travel along wherever you happen to go."

As a source for facts and research ideas, it is very good. It has drawbacks in other areas, however.First, the entire point of the book seems flawed. Buck wanted to take a Chinese city that had all the ingredients needed to turn itself into a modern Western-style city, and see whether such a transformation could have taken place, and if not, why not. The entire premise is that the Western-style city is the natural course for a city to take, and China is somehow lacking for failing to develop in the same way as the West. In reality, might it not be Western cities that are the anomalies?In addition, Buck's conceptual framework, while dealing with Western ideas of the city, makes only a passing reference to the work of Skinner, as though Buck was rushed for time and could not fully incorporate Skinner's economic ideas into his thesis. Although the title of the book claims that the book goes through 1949, in reality it stops somewhere in the early 1930s, with a vague later section which merely repeats then-current Communist rhetoric about turning &quot;consumer cities&quot; into &quot;producer cities.&quot; This rhetoric is not subjected to critical scrutiny.I wished for more maps and other visual material, as well as for more stories, non-scholarly sources such as novels and plays, and other materials that would have given a more vivid sense of the city. If one compares this book to the later 2-volume work on the city of Hankow by Rowe, Buck's book does seem lacking; nevertheless, it remains a valuable resource for students of Shandong province."

Leake ""sailor and scholar""",64/64,4.0,982886400,Very useful to learners of Arabic,"The Mawrid Arabic-English is a good, complete dictionary, perhaps - no, certainly - the best published in the Middle East. It works in alphabetical order, which is good for the beginner as well as for the intermediate learner who's searched through a root-order dictionary without success for a word. The major flaw with this book is that it's aimed at Arab readers and as a result, simple grammatical information like broken plurals or masdars is not shown with the base noun or verb. Learners of Arabic will find the root-order Wehr more useful, but if they can afford two, buy this too, especially as Wehr hasn't been updated in over 25 years while the Mawrid is frequently updated. (I own both.)The Mawrid English-Arabic dictionary is perhaps the best available because, though the Oxford English-Arabic Dictionary of Current Usage is more useful to learners of Arabic for reasons of Arabic grammatical content, the Oxford is 40 years old and the language had expanded significantly. Again, buy both, but here the Mawrid English-Arabic would be my first choice (you can always use Wehr to look up the grammatical info)."

Before that, the Hans Wehr dictionary was all I had to go on. Since this dictionary isn't based on the three consonant root system, there is no need to know the root of an arabic word before looking it up. There have been quite a few words which I could not find in my Hans Wehr because I simply didn't know the root. I use this dictionary to look up words when I don't know the root. Once a word is found, I can easily find the root by looking at the arabic definition and similar words provided. Knowing the root enables me to use my Hans Wehr in order to find the verb forms, examples of usage, and more elaborate definitions in english.This dictionary doesn't give the verb forms and the definitions are not that detailed because examples of word usage is nonexistent. The book is also too large and a real pain in the neck to carry around. It's good for looking up words quickly and finding roots, but for more serious study of arabic there is no substitute for the Hans Wehr dictionary of modern written arabic."

The first few reviews are labelled so, and later reviews, while not so labelled, refer to features like the ""The fine hardcover binding..."" and ""... a dictionary for Arabic and English brovrebs [sic: proverbs] - translated back and forth"" which are not included in this paperback edition. Also, both books have the same number of reviews. Without having checked all the reviews individually, I believe Amazon has cross-linked the reviews of the hardback version to the paperback version as if they were the same aside from the binding, but THEY ARE NOT.2) The typeset is too small - if you are not fairly familiar with the basic arabic script, you will have difficulty discerning the Arabic spelling of some words.3) The English-Arabic portion is poorly organized for translation into Arabic. For example, the entry ""flush"" is followed by 16 definitions, without English equivalents or indication of parts of speech. Multiple undifferentiated definitions of English words are common. The book appears to be an Arabic dictionary of English and an English dictionary of Arabic bound together. If you are a student of Arabic and need to translate English words into Arabic, this dictionary is of little use.4) The paperback edition currently being shipped is VERY poorly bound.

Once I knew how the vitamins and minerals are used and how they interact with each other, it all made sense. I especially liked having the information on the safe amounts of usage. I was able to use her guide to determine if I was taking a safe combination or not. (Of course you should always consult with your doctor, because as she states in her book, some medications affect the absorbancy of supplements and vise versa.) This is the best vitamin and mineral guide I have found. I owned her first edition from 1994 and was pleased to find her updated edition from 2000. She is up-to-date with the latest research and makes your homework much easier."

Crane ""Kiwi Guy""",15/15,4.0,1149292800,Useful car tour guide to some of the best sites,"The ""Book Description"" given under Editorial Reviews is a fair account of the book content.Other than the introductory historical overview, the book comprises three itineraries for those with a car. The book is not aimed at those using Irelands public transport.The itineraries are not based geographically but on three historical periods:-Pre celtic, neolithic and Bronze age-Pre Christian celtic and late Bronze age-Early Christian, Irish golden age and medievalThe first itinerary covering 4000BCE to 700BCE starts in Dublin and takes you to the following principal sites: National musuem of Ireland in Dublin, Bru na Boinne-Newgrange and Knowth passage tombs, Loughcrew hilltop passage tomb complex, Carrowkeel and Carrowmore neolithic cemetery complexes near Sligo, Knocknarea mountain top cairn, Creevykeel court cairn, Ceide Fields neolithic farm settlement, Pulnabrone portal tomb and wedge tombs in Burren National Park (south of Galway), Lough Gur neolithic settlement site, Grange stone circle (largest in Ireland) and nearby wedge tomb (all south of Limerick), Fourknocks passage tomb and Pipers Stones stone circle, and thence back to Dublin. In my opinion it is a good selection of the sites from that period.The other two itineraries take you to such sites as the Hill of Tara, Croagh Patrick, Clonmacnoise, Gallarus oratory near Dingle, Skellig Michael off the west coast, Ardmore, Rock of Cashel, Jeppoint Abbey ( I loved the wonderful carvings), and Glendalough ( just south of Dublin). Again I think these are a good selection of the best known sites.There are maps of the individual sites. However there is just one overall map that shows the 3 routes on one page. Most travelers will want to see sites from all three periods as they tour around, and the book really offers no advice if you wish to do this. But you can do it, as I did, with help of good maps. There are few suggestions of many additional sites to visit if you are keen and have more time. A short gazetter of such sites and location at the back would have been useful.The book also offers no suggestions for further reading on particular periods or sites if you wished to do so.With these reservations aside, as a colourful travel introduction to ancient sites of Ireland, it is a very good book.For more advice on other sites worth visiting try Peter Harbisons ""Guide to the National and Historic monuments of Ireland"" 2001 edition with map references you can link to the very fine 1:250,000 scale touring maps produced by the Irish Ordnance Survey which show lots of such ancient and historic sites as named small red dots (and lots of tourist sites as well). I know as I used these maps.Go and explore!"

One of my friends is touring Ireland by car this spring, and I sent her this book and the Ireland AA road atlas. All the popular guidebooks include the famous places, but the quiet, secluded ones that are not accessible by tour bus are the most evocative. For example, Newgrange (wonderful) is crowded and full of tour buses and shuttle buses, while Carrowkeel (the best) is just you and the sheep (be sure to close all the farm gates). I would not choose to take a trip and visit only sites related to one era, as presented in this guide, but I selected the places and marked them on the map, then used this book to help find them. Many sites are not marked with signs at all, and others only if you approach from a certain direction (you must visit rural Ireland to know what I mean).

I had perused Arberry's and had to put it down in disgust over his superficial attempt to co-opt this man into the religious realm. Arberry's influence being what it was, and as it remains, it is a real disservice to those scholars who can't read Persian well enough to appreciate Mowlana first hand.This book goes even further. Not only the interpretations are not close, most the word plays and double entendre are lost, the author moves verses and above all, he adds verses where there are none! I consider this a misguided presentation of the few poems he has selected. After reading a few, I decided to check them against the originals. This is what I found.Gazal number 2045, (Cowan's 37) has a final verse about Shams which doesn't exist. Its crudeness prompted to check my two copies of the divan and the version on ganjoor.org. None have this weird verse.Samething with Gazal number 2395 (Cowan's 41). No final verse, noting about Shams (Sun) as he has glibly made up.I have shut the book. It is a disgrace. I looked at three poems, two of them have been appended with the interpreters own imagination.The question is motivation. Why are these translators presenting Mowlana's work like that of mindless ""new age"" person? To anyone who understands Persian, these are works of inquiry into psychology and perception using ones own experiences as the singular source. So what is the reason behind all the ""spiritualism"" painted on Mowlana by western scholars, and I use that word in its loosest sense.A. J. Arberry's interpretations were over the top in religiosity and mindless spiritualism. Cowan's attempts seems to be to further such denigration by pretending that the poems are about earthly love.In my reading, of tes of times per poem, his poem are neither religious, nor spiritual or ecstatic. A direct reading of this man's work shows a very clear headed man of exquisite sensitivity questioning every feeling he perceives and every inspiration that surprises him, the incongruity of his feeling and anything that people assume to be external to it, he is wondering about his source of inspiration, not outside, but in his own brain, as he very clearly says in several of his poems, that it is all in his brain. He doesn't even use the word mind, but he clearly says brain, they physical thing in his skull.I would not recommend either of the translations/interpretations mentioned here. I have no idea where one can find a clearheaded one. I pity scholars, students and poetry lovers who need an accessible translation/interpretation. This man's work was centuries ahead of itself, he is delving into and analyzing his creativity and perception in ways that hard neuroscience is just getting to do.There is much that can be learned from Mowlana in terms of the relationship between an artists creative unconscious and his conscious, lost self. These translations are full of sugar and no substance. If you want to enjoy it the level of a Madona song, well, then maybe they work."

Soon he meets a mysterious, beautiful girl named Graziella, who works in the ice cream shop. Graziella brings Percy into parts of Venice that foreigners never get to see, and explains about the turmoil that Venetians are experiencing at the moment. Percy is shown how young Venetians make desperate plans to save their city from danger, and waves of tourists. He also finds how much Venetians hate outsiders, like himself. However, while Graziella and Percy can't change how each of their cultures looks upon the other, they can try to find a common ground for their two worlds to meet upon, during this summer in Venice.I read Donna Jo Napoli's DAUGHTER OF VENICE a few months ago, and was so mesmerized by the story, that I just knew that I had to have FOR THE LOVE OF VENICE. I was not disappointed at all. Percy was a kind character, who was sympathetic, friendly, and helpful. He definitely bears a resemblance to the prince that every girl wishes that she will someday have the chance to meet. Graziella, on the other hand, was hard-headed, and at times snippy, but that was simply her hard exterior. Inside she was warm, friendly, and kind. The two characters keep the book flowing well, and will draw in fans young and old, male or female, into the story.

The major problems created by using race as the main focus of the book include:* Race as a subject is so overworked that nearly everyone over eight years of age has come to conclusions about race, the most important and most common of which is ""I am not racist."" However, given how the human brain works (selective attention, generalization, and others) and how humans interact (tribal affiliation, application of generalizations based on visual input, and so on), prejudice and therefore racism are inevitable: We are all racist whether we think so or not.* Again, because the issue of race is overworked, the reaction of many people when race is introduced as a subject is, ""Not again!"" This could be overcome by a unique or fresh approach. Outside of Chapter 7, ""Toward an Understanding of School Achievement"", nothing new or fresh is provided.On the positive side, the case studies are well written and well selected. In a different literary context, these case studies could be of immense value. Also, Chapter 7 has value to offer.Yes, I realize that racial discrimination issues are critical, especially given the level of racial discriminiation that exists in the human family. However, focusing on such discrimination as the root issue has stalled civil rights. It has accomplished pretty much all it is going to accomplish. It is time to recognize that predudice is part of the human condition.I invite Ms. Nieto or others to write a text based on the biological and sociological roots of prejudice aimed at helping the reader and, in the context of college classes, the student realize their own propensity for prejudice, recognize how it might show up, and correct the issues of their own prejudice as they emerge."

Sayers is one of the top female mystery writers of the twentieth century. Her singular creation of Lord Peter Wimsey assures that her novels will be full of uncanny wit and sparkling intelligence. ""The Nine Tailors"" is a spellbinding mystery with an overabundance of suspects but very little evidence. While some readers may be able to solve the heart of matter, that does not distract from the sheer novelty of this puzzle, steeped in the history and mystery of bell ringing.On a snowy New Year's Eve, Lord Peter Wimsey accidentally runs his car into a ditch outside of the small town of Fenchurch St. Paul. The local rector rescues Wimsey and invites him to stay, soon pressing him to fill in as a substitute for an ill bell ringer. Wimsey gladly takes over the role and has a pleasant albeit strange holiday in the countryside of East Anglia. As he is leaving town, he encounters a tramp looking for work, and thinks nothing further about it. But when a body is discovered buried atop a recently dug grave, the rector calls on Lord Peter again, this time for his detective help.The body found on top of the coffin is greatly disfigured and has had its hands removed, but Wimsey is certain it is the man he met on the road the day out of town. But who is he and how did he get there? Most importantly, who killed him? In searching for this answer, Wimsey and the local inspector are sent following clues to France and retracing the sordid history of some of the town's previous unsavory inhabitants. The identity of the body may prove easier to figure out than the method of his murder.""The Nine Tailors"", the title a reference to the bells that are rung when a man dies, is a unique thought-provoking mystery. Dorothy L. Sayers brings her story full circle and no small piece of information or clue gleaned along the way is left out. For those unfamiliar with bell-ringing, some of the descriptions and dialogue regarding this topic may seem tedious, but are not ones that should be overlooked in order to see the whole picture. ""The Nine Tailors"" is an enjoyable, puzzling whodunit sure to please mystery fans everywhere."
9993552011,The Nine Tailors,,ASOJUBRHQI1DW,IRA Ross,11/14,3.0,1057104000,The Bells Toll,"Lord Peter Wimsey, sleuth extrordinaire, assists the Police Superintendent of Fenchurch St. Paul to identify the body of a man buried in the recently deceased Lady Thorpe's grave. The grave was meant to be shared by Lady Thorpe's husband, who recently died during an influenza epidemic. Wimsey and the Superintendent also endeavor to find out who so sadistically defaced the grave's temporary occupant and why, and hope to uncover secrets related to the theft of a valuable emerald necklace and its connection, if any, to the unidentified body. On the way to the resolution of these misdeeds, I endured an endlessly tedious analysis of the crimes and possible perpetrators' motives. The introduction of a cryptogram allegedly sent by the unidentified victim is an over-elaborate plot device that I found more than a bit trite.What gives this book a big boost, though, is Ms. Sayers' scintillating presentation of synchronized ringing of the Fenchurch St. Paul's bells by rope. Ms. Sayers creates imagery of sheer beauty and magnificence. I almost felt as if I were there experiencing such overwhelming loveliness. The names of two of the bells, Batty Thomas and Tailor Paul are colorful and also figure strongly in the plot. The actions of the heroic Mr. Venables, the church Rector, who assists the towns people and helps to pull them together during a horrific flood is very memorable. I also enjoyed reading various quotations from the Psalms and other parts of the Bible that were peppered throughout the book and gave it the poignance that it might not otherwise have had."

Smith,3/3,5.0,1296864000,One of Sayers's two or three best!,"To the geeks among her readership, this is one of Sayers's most thoroughly fascinating novels featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Peter and Bunter are driving through the Norfolk fens late one blizzardy New Year's Eve when the car goes into a ditch and they have to hike through the blowing snow to the nearest village of Fenchurch St. Paul. They're taken in by the elderly rector and his wife, who assure them the car can be rescued in the morning -- but just now, the rector is planning a big event in the huge 11th century parish church across the road. Mr. Venables is an avid bell-ringer with a crack team of rope-pullers from the village under him and they're about to attempt a full peal of Kent Treble Bob Major -- 15,840 rings, taking more than nine hours. ""Ringing the changes"" means following mathematical progression, not playing tunes. It's a peculiarly English avocation and has been for a long time; Batty Thomas, the oldest bell of the eight in the belfry of St. Paul's, was cast in 1368 and the local records of progressive ringing go back more than two hundred years. It's also an arcane subject with its own jargon: ""`Make it a 704,' said the Rector. `Call her in the middle with a double, before, wrong, and home, and repeat.'"" And Sayers doesn't bother to explain any of this, which keeps it all mysterious and rather bewildering. (One could wishe she had included an explanatory appendix.) Anyway, one of the ringers is suddenly taken by influenza and Wimsey, an old bell-ringer himself, naturally, is dragooned into substituting -- which he carries off successfully, to everyone's grateful delight. And then the car is fixed and Wimsey and Bunter proceed on their way. Meanwhile, the local squire dies and preparations are made to bury him in the same grave with his wife, who had passed away only a few months before. But in opening the grave, another body is discovered just below the surface, an unknown intruder with a battered face and lacking its hands (and its fingerprints). The local cops are having no luck with the case so the rector writes a hopeful note to Wimsey in London: Might he have some suggestions as to how to proceed? Hah! A mystery, and under highly unusual circumstances! Peter's down there like a shot! And then things begin to get complicated. There was this theft of a very valuable emerald necklace back in 1914, and various people died or went to prison, but the emeralds were never recovered. And as Lord Peter's investigation widens, it becomes clear that the two cases are intertwined. The suspects pile up but they all seem to have alibis -- and besides, Wimsey discovers that the people he personally likes appear to be the best suspects, which doesn't make him happy. It's a complex plot, with some notable characters among both the cops and the fen people, as well as the absent-minded rector himself. And the water-logged fens are a major player, too. This is widely considered one of Sayers's very best efforts and I have to say I agree."

Bennetts,2/2,5.0,1300060800,Arguably the greatest detective novel of all time,"This, the ninth of Sayers's eleven full length Wimsey novels, is the one that lifts her above the category of twentieth-century female detective novelist, and places her among the literary greats.It is a thoroughly satisfying mystery - sophisticated, complex, intellectually challenging. Everything in the plot is there for a reason; and the final explanation is ingenious and unexpected.It is Sayers, so there is more than just a plot. The characters have a depth and realism far beyond the caricatures of Agatha Christie. They have individuality and weaknesses and baggage and unexpected strength in the face of adversity. They are, in short, people.Wimsey himself appears more relaxed in this than in most of the other books. A far cry from the self-conscious man-about-town of Whose Body? or the nervy war veteran of The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, this is the Wimsey hinted at in Five Red Herrings: the born and bred countryman, at ease with himself, almost classless at times, an incomer who at once instinctively understands and is accepted by this tiny community.The community itself is minutely and deftly drawn too - partly through its supporting characters, partly through Sayers's own narrative voice, stronger and more distinctive in this book than in the others, and often taking on the cadence and the overtones of a local character to remarkable effect.And then there are the most powerful and enduring characters of all: the bells of Fenchurch St Paul and the place itself. `The Nine Tailors' is to the Fens what `The Return of the Native' is to the heathlands of Dorset. It is a work of art, a tone-poem, a sonorous evocation of place and time, a symphony of words and images that endure in the mind long after the last page is turned. (For more on the power of language in `The Nine Tailors', I refer you to my recent essay on The Art of Reading at [...])Much attention is given in literary circles to the `great American novel'; little, if any, is given to the novel that depicts England. Yet `The Nine Tailors', for all that it is set in an obscure and bleak corner of the countryside, is as intimate and accurate a portrait of inter-war Englishness as anything ever written - and an enduring one at that.~~~One must then turn, with the utmost reluctance and distaste, to the current sub-standard UK paperback edition of this masterpiece (978-0-450-00100-0). It appears to have been typeset and proof-read by persons with little knowledge of, and less interest in, either the English language or the basic rules of punctuation. It is further encumbered with an arch and self-congratulatory introduction by Elizabeth George, which adds little to one's appreciation of the work, and which - to add insult to injury - is inserted between Sayers's own foreword and the first chapter, thus breaking the rhythm of the author's original text. (No doubt the same vandalism has been committed in the latest impression of Gaudy Night, where any interruption between the Foreword and Chapter 1 would be even more obtrusive. Fortunately I still have my 1988 paperback of that work.)A minor point, but a further niggle in light of these graver shortcomings, is the faintly 1970s typography employed for the section headings.In summary, this edition gives the unfortunate impression of having been brought to press by an editor who neither recognised nor valued the calibre and significance of the book. I have now placed my 2011 paperback in the recycling bin and ordered a second-hand hardback. On the grounds of the punctuation errors alone, I would urge anyone who wishes to read what Miss Sayers actually wrote, to eschew the current paperback edition in favour of any other second-hand copy available."

But the ones that followed that were polished, confident, intelligent, and her writing elevates her above the realm of ""mere"" mystery writer. She stands head and shoulders above Christie.Murder Must Advertise is light and flippant, sassy, and so entertaining to read. Think of it as a light meringue cookie by an expert pastry chef.But the Nine Taylors is the meaty and rich main course. It just a beautifully fleshed out book. Atmospheric, descriptive, characters she's just breathed life into, it's just a lovely read, and I have done so at least ten times. It really gives you a feeling of Norfolk and the people, and the intense detail about the ringing of the bells and the draining of the fens is just fascinating. Don't read it for the mystery, read it just for the for the sheer joy of the excellent prose.Whether you are a mystery fan, or just love good books, do reward yourself and take the time to read this one.

Ezekiel Mphahlele paints a vivid picture of the struggles and tribulations of black people in the old South Africa.It's a well written book about the life of a young man, Eseki, growing up in rural South Africa who then moves to the city. It's about how people moved from the countryside and relocated to townships made just for black and coloured people in the early 1940's.We are taken from Eseki's youth, his schooling, until he succeeds and becomes a teacher. But like many youths at the time gets involved in politics and ultimately bared from practising his skill in the country by the ruling party. He goes to Nigeria were he finds peace and can finally teach.This literature is a view from a different perspective of how people are treated differently, even though they might have the same qualifications. It takes us from a poverty stricken beginning to a political young life and then to finding solace in teaching in a foreign country.Down Second Avenue can be related to works by other writers who lived through the struggle years.

This book gives some insight into the racial and economic struggles of black families, but it is more of his own life experiences, which certainly give insight into the racial tensions and present a clear picture of poverty in South Africa, but were somewhat disappointing as I was hoping to find a historical and sociological study of racial tensions in South Africa. The language is beautiful, however, and Mphahlele is a very distiguished and talented writer. I was remined of Naguib Mahfouz's Midaq Alley in Mphahlele's funny descriptions and antecdotes about his neighbors. As far as the content, however, I was disappointed by the lack of insight I gained into South African society and politics."

I wish he had included camping areas on his maps, but alas, he did not. His descriptions are thorough and at times humorous, and he includes extra information like nice pieces of scenery to look for and information on water gauges.What could be considered either a weakness or strength is that Gertler excluded lakes and reservoirs from his book. I do not consider this to be a downside, because lakes are generally calm and flat, and do not pose many hazards like rivers and streams do. Therefore, devoting a lot of text to them is unnecessary. Plus, information about publically accessible lakes is readily available on the web, unlike many of the smaller streams Gertler has in his book."

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to write great copy - and is also an excellent refresher for experienced copywriters who wish to re-invigorate their copy by taking a little time to review the essentials. The primary advantage of this book over other copy manuals is that it's not written expressly for individuals who wish to make writing copy their profession. Rather, it's also written for business people who don't necessarily want to be professional writers, but who need to write copy as part of their business responsibilities. As a result, it's an especially invaluable resource for small business owners who don't have the budget or inclination to hire a pro-and who, instead, take on copywriting responsibilities themselves.Kranz covers the full range of copywriting venues, whether it's direct mail, e-mail, advertising, PR, web sites and/or collateral. And in every instance, he clearly and expertly elucidates the keys to writing great copy-with how-to tips, pointers on what to avoid, nuts and bolts technical advice, and writing exercises that enable the reader to turn thought into action. Throughout the book, Kranz displays a welcome wit that nicely complements the wealth of factual information that's included-for example, he writes, ""Telling is for journalists, teachers and stool pigeons. Copywriting is about conducting business, not distributing information."" Kranz also uses analogies to good effect-at one point, comparing the emotional logic of a good direct mail letter to that of a fairy tale. I'll leave the full explanation of the comparison to Kranz-but it's one of innumerable places in this book where you find yourself saying, ""Yeah, that's an excellent point."" The author also references writing for different types of businesses-and gives pithy examples for hypothetical businesses such as Sugar Daddy's Car Wash, Round Table Books, Empty Nest Realty Group, DataPlus Oscilloscopes, Danny's Donuts, and so on.All told, I give this book the highest marks. Sometimes, readers need a ""how to"" primer on how to select the best ""how to"" books. My advice: If you want to learn how to be an effective copywriter, make this the one ""how to"" book you absolutely read."

Kranz also gives a detailed breakdown of what goes into a direct mail package, that should be enough to get any beginning mailer off to a promising start.There are many books written about copywriting, that are aimed at business owners or the unfortunate folks who get stuck writing copy for their company because they once correctly used ""presume"" in an email.

B000JSHBXW,THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.,,AYNSTQDLZ9TVX,P J Bower,25/26,5.0,1006300800,Forgotten Classic,"I picked up this book by the great Twentieth-Century philosophical theologian Paul Tillich and was pleasantly suprised. Being familiar with Tillich's rather dry systematic theology, I was expecting more of the same. However, I was greeted by an immensely readable collection of sermons which I found both inspirational, thought-provoking and masterful. If Tillich's dogmatic theology is now regarded as out-moded, this sample of his devotional literature marks him out as insightful and relevant: he speaks as much to our generation as to the one he was speaking to.While the opening sermon 'The Shaking of the Foundations' is a little anachronistic in that it is couched in the terms of a by-gone debate (critiqueing mid-Twentieth-Century liberal theology)its message is an enduring one: that humanity must recognise its dependence on God and trust in him rather than in humanity's own inadequate ability. What follows this sermon is pure delight. The remainder of the collection testifies to Tillich's honesty and profound insight into the human heart and the tensions of human existence. 'You are accepted' is probably the best of the rest, expounding on the frustrations of life, and being unable to live up to your own expectations, let alone God's. Furthermore, it sounds a confident note of grace. It certainly stirred up a few emotions in me, I can tell you.On the negative side, those of a more conservative Christian persuasion may be troubled by the implications of Tillich's Christology. The question I was left asking, however, concerned Tillich's eschatology (the 'last things'). It seemed to me that Tillich either didn't believe in an ultimate overcoming of evil, or he simply wanted to emphasise the present reality of God's victory over it. I suspect there is some truth in both alternatives: Tillich was a complicated man, with an ambiguous relationship to the Christian faith, almost, it seems, of a love-hate quality.Nevertheless, don't let this, or anything else you might hear of Tillich, deter you from reading The Shaking of the Foundations. It truly deserves to be regarded as a modern classic of devotional literature."
B000JSHBXW,THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.,,AMMEMPM9MPS55,www.DavidLRattigan.com,14/15,3.0,1005696000,Accessible Tillich,"Tillich is by no means the most accessible of contemporary theologians. However, this collection of his sermons speaks immediately to everyman. He speaks perceptively of the dilemmas and anxieties of human existence, pointing emphatically to God as the source of salvation from human frustration and guilt. He delivers poignant critiques of modernistic attitudes, distancing himself firmly from the old liberal school of the 19th century and destroying the enlightenment illusion of progress, directing our hopes to God instead.I must confess that it was against my better judgment that I allowed this little collection of sermons to affect me: I am an evangelical, whereas Tillich belongs to a decidedly more liberal stream of theology to say the least! This is not to say he does not speak like an evangelical, just that I couldn't escape the feeling of intellectual dishonesty as I enjoyed Tillich's writings with the nagging suspicion that he didn't mean anything like the same thing by his use of particular theological terms as I mean. A read of Tillich's far less digestable Systematic Theology will enlighten you as to his philosophy of symbolism in religious language. He clearly maintains that the Christian faith alone can exclusively lay claim to truth; yet the language of Christian doctrine, whilst irreplaceable, is only symbolic, participating in what it represents yet, nevertheless, incapable of objectively describing what it represents. The evangelical might well benefit from reading 'Shaking of the Foundations' if he can overlook this tension; the non-conservative will not need to.Tillich was a bundle of contradictions, in a sense. He argues passionately for the truth of the Christian gospel, yet he was hardly ever known to go to church, except to preach, perhaps. He is also reputed to have had a string of affairs. I suppose the greatest comfort one can draw from that is that Tillich certainly knew what he was talking about when, along with St. Paul, he affirmed the pervading despair and tension that characterizes human existence.The most impressing sermons contained in the book are: 'Shaking of the Foundations' in which the preacher lambasts the naive optimism of the enlightenment and prophetically challenges modernism with the warning of a 'shaking of the foundations' which will expose the bankruptcy of confidence in modern progress, leaving the (E)ternal standing; 'The Witness of the Spirit to the Spirit' on the subject of the Christian's assurance; and 'You Are Accepted', a life-giving exposition of Paul's thought on sin and grace in Romans 5:20: here also is Tillich at his most perceptive and penetrating."

You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you...""This is how faith really is: not something taught but something discerned when you least expect it, in the still quiet moments of our lives, in those moments when we feel most troubled and alone.

He added ""A large part of the congregation at the Sunday services came from outside the Christian crcle in the most radical sense of the phrase. For them, a sermon in traditional Biblical terms would have had no meaning. Therefore, I was obliged to seek a language which expresses in other terms the human experience to which the Biblical and ecclesiastical terminology point.""Here are some representative excerpts:""The name of this inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is God... For if you know that God means depth, you know much about Him. You cannot then call yourself an atheist or unbeliever. For you cannot think or say: Life has no depth!... If you could say this in complete seriousness, you would be an atheist; but otherwise you are not.

Sloan Jr. was CEO of General Motors from 1923 to 1946. This book was originally published in 1964. Sloan is seen as the first person to have worked out systematic organization in a big company, planning and strategy, measurements, the principle of decentralization - in short, basic concepts of a discipline of management. This is a difficult book to review, since it is more a historic piece on GM's history and development from Sloan's perspective than an autobiography. It does not discuss the individual Alfred P. Sloan Jr., it discusses Alfred P. Sloan Jr. as professional manager. The chapters also come across as business school lessons in different subjects, ranging from general management through to accounting, marketing and compensation strategies.The book consists of two parts. &quot;Part One is an integrated continuous story of the main lines of General Motors' progress, involving the origin and development of the corporation's basic management concepts in the areas of organization, finance and product.&quot; It discusses the extreme growth and development of the automobile industry from the early 1900s through to the early 1960s. It also discusses the methods General Motors introduced used to manage the corporation (Sloan all through the book keeps emphasizing the concept of the corporation). He later became known as a committee-man, because he used different types of committees to get/keep various divisions talking and working with each other.&quot;Part Two consists of individually distinct sections dealing in some detail with engineering, distribution, overseas operations, war and defense products, incentive compensation, and other aspects and branches of the enterprise.&quot; This part of the book discusses in greater detail the different experiences and events during Sloan's reign as CEO. It discusses some very interesting subjects, such as the evolution of the automobile, relationships with dealers, World War I and II efforts, and personnel and labor relations. Chapter 23 and 24 are really the conclusion to this book.Yes, this is a great book. It is a TRUE business classic. It discusses all the subjects involved in business from a CEO's point of view. I was amazed to see the amount of detail Sloan has gone through while writing this book, there are plenty of quotes from annual reports, memoranda, conversations, etc. However, some readers will be disappointed by the lack of insight into Sloan's personal life. This particular edition includes an introduction by Peter F. Drucker, who explains why this book is MUST reading for all MBA and business students, but also all people that want to be serious about management. Highly recommended. The book is written in simple business US-English."

He grew GM from a bunch of mechanical geniuses and seat-of-the-pants administrators to the biggest company in the world after World War two.However, the U.S. auto industry was at the peak of its powers and was about to begin the long slow (but inevitable) decline. And unfortunately you can see why. In 1964 autos wouldn't last more than a few years, and were sold on the basis of the annual model change. It truly was a seller's market, and you can see how the problems of today stem from the attitudes of that time.Sloan is at his best describing the period 1921-1929 when the industry fell into place. The thirties get little mention and the period after the war is treated as one long period with no developments.Sloan is glib when it comes to showing off the attitudes of management of that time. Because GM couldn't sell high-profit cars during the war but instead did defence work, this ""proves"" that wars do not benefit business. There are two chapters, one on labor relations (""how we kept the hourly paid workers' wages down""), and following that, on executive bonuses (""must be kept in place"").It's a worthwhile read, but it's becoming more historical than instructional."

Sloan tells the story of his years as president and CEO of General Motors. His story is relevant for anyone who needs advice on how to save a company that is on the verge of bankruptcy and get it growing. Sloan has divulged his insights on organizational structure, management processes, financial control, product strategy and research. Here is some of the advice he offers:Balance cooperation and control: Sloan implemented a framework of coordinated policy and decentralized operations. Top managers made policy, and individual business units were free to implement the policy in the way they wanted. He created interdivisional committees to ensure continuity.Management. Rather than expecting managers to behave like drill sergeants, Sloan pushed for ""selling"" at all levels. Corporate leaders were expected to sell their policy decisions to divisions. Division managers were encouraged to sell operational initiatives to top management.Finances. Sloan created a system for reviewing appropriation requests to control spending. He also created a system of four-month forecasts to make sure the size of inventory did not exceed the needs of production.Product Strategy. Sloan developed a marketing strategy for General Motors to offer an automobile for every price range. The company had previously been stuck offering cars only in the mid-price range, and had lost considerable market share to Ford.Research. Sloan recognized that research was just as important as manufacturing and put both research and operations on the same organizational plane.Distribution. Sloan turned automobile dealers into business partners and simplified the process of distribution for General Motors. He also created GMAC, a financing entity that allowed the ""average man"" to buy a car and pay in installments. When he began this program, banks refused to lend money to working people to buy automobiles, considering them a bad risk."

What I found it to be was a fairly dry chronicle of the ascension of GM. I have no doubt that Sloan was a genius and perhaps the book was more of a revelation in 1963.However, today many of the strategies discussed are somewhat obvious. For example, one of the overarching themes in the book is Sloan's belief in decentralization. At some point he realized that some centralization relative to certain business functions is needed. The company fine tuned this balance over the years and this is discussed in detail. This makes alot of sense but this a process that is taken for granted today. Anyone working in the business world for a few years at a medium to large sized company has seen this phenomena in action.There is also quite a bit of material about financial controls which is good, again nothing revolutionary although the techniques were probably innovative for the time. In the end, I think the book works better as a decent history of the auto industry and GM although the writing style is so dry most ""car nuts"" would find it boring.The history of the auto industry is populated with some remarkable characters, many of which were very eccentric with a real passion for automobiles. You won't find any anecdotes about that in this book, and of course that was by design. Sloan's intent was to chronicle the history of GM and his involvement with the company, and that is what he does. However, he does it in such a matter of fact way that some folks might find it tough to stick with it to the end. Not exactly a cure for insomnia but comes dangerously close at times."

The book is well-positioned with the Bill Gates quote on the cover that reads, in part, ""... the best book to read if you want to read only one book about business..."". I completely agree with that!This book is better than any other book I am aware of regarding the Automobile industry if you are interested in business and management evolution. It provides much better insights into business than books I have read by and about say John DeLorean, Lee Iacocca, or Howard Hughes. Those other books may be more entertaining however for people looking for entertainment. This book provides broader insights into general industrial management for contemporary use than say the two books written by Bill Gates do.This 1990 edition of ""My Years with General Motors"" also provides an insightful introduction by Peter F. Drucker that adds considerably to the understanding of Alfred P. Sloan. This book is interesting for what it doesn't cover as well as for what it does cover.It does seem Mr Sloan believed in the importance of a well defined structure for management, a constitution if you will. However, the ultimate goal is to put people to work to produce the best possible result. Leadership is seen as more important than structure by Sloan, this is not what the popular opinion of General Motors would be however.That is why I recommend reading this book as an Excellent Historical Account of Management at General Motors.

B0007K8ZEQ,My years with General Motors (Business leader's book),,A1O96IRCAIDZRQ,"T. Graczewski ""tgraczewski""",2/3,5.0,1243814400,"Where have you gone, Alfred Sloan?","It was a bit depressing reading this triumphant memoir - indeed, one of the greatest business books written during the twentieth century - in May 2009 as the benighted American industrial icon, General Motors, slid into bankruptcy. It made the story of Sloan's storied leadership and GM's dramatic early success all the more incredible. Beyond that, ""My Years at General Motors"" resonated with me for a number of reasons.First, Sloan provides a fascinating overview of the early automotive industry in the United States. As someone who was raised in a ""car family"" (my father sold Fords and my uncle managed a GM dealership), the story of how Durant and then the DuPonts and Sloan built GM to overtake Ford and ultimately dominate the car industry is a captivating one. The fact that I spent the first decade of my professional career in the software industry, which in the 2000s roughly equates to the car business in the 1920s, only added to the allure of this book.Second, as an executive in a central role in a business unit-dominated company I sympathized with the challenges that Sloan faced in getting control of such a distributed organization as GM in the 1920s. As Sloan describes it, his goal was ""decentralization with co-ordinated control.""Third, it is sobering to read what can happen to a genuinely disruptive innovative organization over time. According to Sloan, GM was a pioneer on multiple fronts: the first to develop market segmentation of car brands and the roll-out of the annual model; the first to create a dedicated, central group focusing on body styling; the first to create a range of financial operating metrics across business units; the first to treat their dealers as an integrated part of their total operations; the most aggressive automotive firm in developing consumer finance (GMAC) for car purchases; a technical innovator in the commercial development of the diesel engine for locomotives; a leader in human resource incentive compensation models; and a leading inventor in consumer refrigeration (Frigidaire). Most amazing, from my perspective, was the work of GM's Post War Policy Planning Group, which before the German defeat at Stalingrad issued a detailed report that accurately laid out the contours of the coming Cold War and described how GM would compete in a bipolar political world. (""The net result of the foregoing general viewpoints...is that there will probably be certain lines of demarcation or division to the west, south and east of the Soviet Union, within which the Russian idea will predominate, and outside of which the American and British viewpoint will prevail."")That said, for all of GM's purported innovation under Sloan, his story makes it clear that the greatest factor in the demise of Henry Ford's dominance was classic external market disruption, namely the emergence of the used car market and installment paying. GM simply took better advantage of these developments and others than Ford.Finally, Sloan and his fellow GM executives were incredibly lucid writers. For me, this was the most glaring difference between then and now in corporate America. Much of this memoir is made up of extended quotes from Sloan's internal policy papers. The clarity and crispness of these documents is impressive. By reading these nearly century-old memoranda - and without knowing the first thing about the automotive industry in general or 1920s era General Motors in particular - one can easily grasp the central facts and critical dilemmas that Sloan and his fellow executives faced. Just imagine trying to do the same reading the interminable e-mail threads and obtuse PowerPoint strategy decks that undoubtedly have flown back-and-forth between recently ousted GM CEO Richard Wagoner and his top lieutenants. (Note: interestingly enough, the contemporary exception to this Twitterization of business strategy is Amazon.com, where CEO Jeff Bezos requires that any new ideas be presented in clearly articulated white papers, not PowerPoint.)In sum, Alfred Sloan is a real lion; an aggressive and imaginative businessman of the first order. In the closing chapter of his celebrated memoir Sloan writes: ""There have been and always will be many opportunities to fail in the automobile industry."" Unfortunately, it appears that his unworthy executive heirs at GM have, in a perverse sense, taken full advantage of the many opportunities afforded them."
B0007K8ZEQ,My years with General Motors (Business leader's book),,A2AUP9BEGX8D2S,Paul Eckler,2/3,5.0,1215475200,A look inside General Motors,"""My Years with General Motors,"" by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr, Doubleday, NY, 1963, with introduction by Peter Drucker, 1990. Sloan was President/CEO/Chairman of the Board of General Motors from 1923 to 1956. He created the systems and organization that made GM a great corporation. That organization was studied as the model for large corporations for decades. The book also provides a look into the history of GM and its various strategies.General Motors was created by William C. Durant in 1908. Beginning with Buick, he acquired a series of auto companies including Olds, Oakland, and Cadillac, with the idea of competing with the then market leader, Henry Ford's Model T. Durant was the visionary who brought together much of the modern GM, but his organizational style was hands on-producing delays in decision making. He also lacked adequate financial controls. He was forced to resign as President in 1920 when the slowdown of 1921 forced financial difficulties on the company and later on Durant himself caused by margin calls due to speculation in company stock.The Dupont Company was a major investor in General Motors until forced to divest its shares in the 1950s. Dupont's investment began in 1917, when they saw GM as a growth opportunity. They hoped to supplement earnings that might otherwise decline after World War I. In addition, Dupont made the transition from an explosives company to a chemical company after World War I based on surplus nitrocellulose capacity. Plants had been constructed for the Allies during the war to make smokeless powder and later were sold at distress prices. Nitrocellulose proved suitable in auto paint and in the fabric coatings used on auto tops. The investment gave Dupont access to the chemical needs of the auto industry during a major growth phase. Initially Dupont personnel staffed the GM Finance Department.Pierre S. Dupont came out of retirement to succeed Durant as President of GM. He brought experience in the management of a large corporation. Sloan, meanwhile, came up through a manufacturer of roller bearings acquired by GM. He rose steadily through the ranks and succeeded PS Dupont as President after his resignation in 1923.A strategy had evolved to compete with Ford on styling and quality. Ford had over 50% market share; no one could compete with his costs on much smaller volume. But he kept prices low by making the same model with little or no change year after year. That made Ford slow to adopt improvements. GM planned to compete with Chevrolet, which was to have similar costs based on an air-cooled, copper-clad engine. Air cooling avoided the need for a water jacketed engine block, water pump, radiator, and associated plumbing-a considerable savings. GM Research under Charles Kettering was confident the engine would perform, but the operating divisions were uncomfortable with this unproven engine design. Overheating was a problem which Research worked to resolve, but then 1923 proved to be a strong sales year, and a decision was needed. PS Dupont had put his faith in the copper-clad engine, but it was dropped soon after his resignation. Some say Corvair is the only air-cooled GM model to reach the market (after the VW Beetle established practicality).Sloan makes clear that GM is primarily an engineering company. Most executives have engineering backgrounds. The company is heavily committed to developing new technologies and bringing improvements to market. Sloan pioneered decentralized management to allow divisions to make their own decisions promptly. Headquarter's role was to set policy. He then used corporate committees to promote interactions where appropriate such as in purchasing. He created a return on invested capital system to measure performance of the divisions. This is presumably the system that favored production of SUVs rather than small fuel efficient vehicles.It was Sloan who came up with the pricing brackets that differentiate the GM divisions. (Pontiac was created in 1925 to fill in a gap in the line as a low priced six cylinder model.) He also instituted installment selling (and GMAC to finance it), used car trade-ins, the closed auto body (and added Fisher Body to the GM family), and the annual model change. The annual model was intended to leverage the trend toward comfort, convenience, power, and style in selling new cars.Sloan took pride in the steady improvement in auto technology during his tenure. He mentions the development of ethyl gasoline and high compression engines, improved transmissions-eventually automatic transmissions, balloon tires and improved suspensions, and in 1923, Duco lacquers that made it possible to finish an automobile in an 8 hr shift rather than the two to four weeks once required. Duco was also available in a variety of colors. The first production vehicle was the ""True Blue"" Oakland in 1924.Styling was not ignored. Harley Earl was brought in as stylist in 1926, initially to assist the Cadillac division. His focus was to lengthen and lower the American automobile.Strong dealers were considered essential to success. GM helped its dealers implement accounting methods to better manage their businesses. Financing was available to assist promising dealer candidates who lacked capital.GM was a major factor in the development of diesel locomotives for railroads. The business was a logical extension of internal combustion engines, but also a diversification should recovery of auto sales be slow after the Great Depression. GM's Electromotive Division was the leading manufacturer of diesel locomotives for over 50 years.GM's venture into household appliances, later Frigidaire, began in 1918, when Mr. Durant acquired Guardian Refrigerator Company of Detroit, a home refrigerator company. The initial machines were large and cumbersome. The 1922 model weighed 834 lb. Weight was reduced with an air cooled compressor and air cooled coils in 1926. GM Research in co-operation with Dupont invented Freon-12 as a non-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant gas in 1931. In 1929 they had made 1MM units; in 1932, 2.225MM. Competitors included Kelvinator (1914), GE (1927), Norge (1927), and Westinghouse (1930). Frigidaire was expanded to include a full line of household appliances after World War II.GM ventured into aviation in the days when the piston engines used were not unlike those in motor vehicles. GM had an interest in Bendix Corporation, North American Aviation, TWA, and Eastern Air Lines. Soon after the 1927 Lindbergh flight, some thought personal airplanes, called flivvers, might be in the future. The initial investment was the US division of Fokker Aircraft, the famous Dutch aircraft maker. GM bought a 40% interest while they made planes for the US military and commercial airlines. Later Fokker US was renamed General Aviation and merged into North American Aviation. North American was a holding company that owned Eastern Airlines and stock in TAT, predecessor to TWA, and Western Air Express. The Air Mail Act of 1934 prohibited airplane manufacturers from owning airlines. TWA stock was sold in 1935; Eastern in 1938 (when Eddie Rickenbacker arranged backing to buy the airline). In 1937, Allison Div. of GM completed development of a 1000 hp reciprocating aircraft engine that was widely used in fighter aircraft in World War II. By 1947, 70,000 engines had been made at the plant in Indianapolis.During World War II, the company rapidly converted to production of military equipment. A major problem was the shortage of skilled manpower. Tanks were welded in a merry-go-round system that required learning only one simple weld rather than full scale training.In his later years Sloan created the Alfred P. Sloan foundation to fund basic research, but especially to support talented researchers. He also participated in formation of the Sloan Kettering Cancer Hospital.The book ends with a discussion of labor relations and incentive programs. The appendix includes sales by division for 1909 to 1962, and staff organizational charts. Indexed.This is a highly readable account of the GM story. Sloan omits some unpleasantries. He does not mention the death of workers in the development of leaded gasoline, GM's role in supplying Nazi Germany through its Opel division in World War II, or the violence of some auto strikes. Most will find it fascinating reading."

The book goes into great detail about the creation of committees, policies, procedures, financial development, the evolution of automobiles and its industry, etc. It is almost a blueprint of how to structure a huge automobile company and it gets so tiresome to read all those dry details that I was often struggling to maintain interest (and stay awake.)There is very little about the underlying business philosophy of Alfred Sloan, how he thought, his vision, his management style, etc., which was what I was hoping for.However, Bill Gates of Microsoft praises this book, so perhaps if you are the president of a huge corporation you too will appreciate the book's indepth description of complex corporate issues. For someone more interested in getting to know how great managers think and act in an easy-to-absorb book I would instead recommend Sam Walton's autobiography which is both entertaining and educational as opposed to this drab tale."

Thoroughly familiar with the corporate point of view from years of business writing, De Santis joins those people whose sweat and toil actually build our world. She gives us the private musings and dreams of hardworking folks who didn't get all the breaks in life that she did, and shows their courage and determination to survive the brutal decisions of an unfeeling corporation. It's sad that management just can't understand the rage of these people whose jobs have been given a death sentence for the sake of higher profits, yet who are expected to give 100% down to the last day.

Her fascination though, with ""the other side"", ""the blue collar workers"" would somehow overpower all sanity and she would seek out employment in the bowls of the workforce. Her dreams of writing a book and her journalistic past are her rational for exploring her curiosities. Hiding her outstanding employment credentials, she lands an assembler job with General Motor's lisping Scarborough Van plant. Solange, nicknamed Sally by her line mates, would now have 18 months in which to ""spy"" and compile enough material on life within the plant, before being laid-off, along with its 2,700 strong population. This fascinating account of Sally's perseverance, and demanding requirements associated with manual labor, are truly astonishing. Pushing herself beyond physical limits she thought ever existed, she finds herself becoming attached to her co-workers, ""a cog in the wheel"". A strong bond develops with her work mates through common hardships somewhat like a ""boot camp"". Her vivid descriptions of the sites and sounds within the plant and the people she works with have clear images and sounds popping into my head. Her circle of friends, ""from all woks of life"", are so typical of the many groups within the plant. Reading through her book I find Sally dredging up raw nerve endings I thought were buried long ago, for I am one of the 2,700 employee's of the Scarborough Van Plant that devoted the better part of my working life, along with so many others, to that job, as one of Sally's co-workers, on a different shift, with a different circle of friends, only to find myself one day, writing my resume. This book should appeal to anyone looking for a realistic account of life within those ""dark window factories"", and the typical ""labels"" these people are saddled with. Bravo Sally, an outstanding read in contrast to your Wall Street journalism."

Beverly""",141/147,3.0,1027468800,"Might save you from bad planning, but it leaves a lot unsaid","There is a lot of good information in this book, but there is also a lot missing as well as some misleading information. I'd recommend this book to someone that was planning on building or remodeling with the caveat that they also read from other sources or better consult with established professionals in each and every trade on the project.The strong points of this book include good discussion of doorway layouts, spacing in kitchen and baths, things to look out for that could be problems and good questions to ask or things to consider when planning. Pointing out problems and potential problems that a homeowner may face in the future makes this book worth the money, after all, if after reading this book an owner solves or prevents just one simple mistake, the book has paid for itself many times over.The weak points of this book are why I suggest reading elsewhere or consulting with professionals. I am an electrician by trade so I read the chapter on electrical first. It wasn't that any of the information was really bad or mistaken, but simply that I felt it didn't mention a lot of things that could and should be brought up when planning.The author makes a point (several times) about having three conductor wire run to any potential ceiling fan location. While this isn't bad advice, it's incomplete. Many of the top of the line fans use remote control switching and don't require an extra wire. The best fans I have installed use a remote that is battery operated and the ceiling fan itself is wired to a two conductor wire that isn't even switched. If an owner picked up one of this fans they would now have a switch on the wall that did nothing or worse a switch that if turned off would cancel out the auto temperature function of the remote.While pointing out the importance of having an extra outlet outside for things like Christmas lights, he fails to mention the nice addition of eve high outlets wired to a timer.There are many reasons to consider timer switches, especially for outside wall and path lights. The best is a 7 day 24 hour electronic timer that fits in the space of a regular switch. These can be programed to go off at various times through out the night, a nice feature when on vacation or simply for added security.The use of lighting controls, dimmers, timers, etc. is barely touched on or not discussed at all. While these systems can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, all but very meager budgets such at least consider the options available because for some applications the extra money can be justified.The use of dimming xenon lighting for undercabinet use instead of fluorescent is not discussed. I believe it is a much better option.I also noticed some problems in other trades. The use of insta hot water heaters is mentioned as a good way to save energy in the kitchen because the hot water doesn't have to travel to get there. I am not sure what the author was basing this information on, but it isn't correct. First off he implies that an insta hot can supply water at the sink but he doesn't mention that there are two kinds of systems. One is the insta hot that keeps about a gallon of near boiling water for use in making coffee, tea and instant soups and oatmeal. While this is great for people on the go or someone that doesn't want an elderly member of the family turning on the tea kettle and perhaps forgetting it; it is not an energy saving device. The second kind of insta hot is a small unit that doesn't store any water, it just heats up the water as it passes through the unit. It is really only designed for one purpose only hand washing. In the discussion on supplying extra or insta hot water for bathrooms, the author mentions that planning for the space and supplying electrical or gas are the considerations. But what about venting the unit if it is gas? This is a big consideration and would make adding a second unit not very cost effective. The best solution would simply be to add a circ pump and if necessary increase the size of the water heater. The way the information is laid out in the book would probably just confuse the non-professional.The biggest problem I had in my reading of this book was when I read the author describe linoleum as the floor of choice in the kitchen. I nearly quit reading right there and then and threw the book in the trash. To his credit he does mention that in certain parts of the country tile is the way to go and if you live in those parts it's ok to go with tile. I happen to live in Southern California where linoleum is the flooring used in apartments and condos and cheap o tract homes. I can't believe anyone would recommend linoleum over tile. Tile stands up for years and if one breaks, which is unlikely, it can be replaced with another tile. If linoleum rips, which it's easy to do when moving appliances around, it is not as easy to fix as replacing a tile and regrouting, it will have to have a seam and seams tend to come apart after time. Plus linoleum over the years tends to get dull with wear while tile can be cleaned and resealed, linoleum is a print on paper and once it wears out or is ripped or scratched it can't be taken back to it's pristine state. While I personally hate the current trend in fake wood floors (laminates) because I think they look fake, I think a compelling argument could be made to use them over linoleum. The author of this book obviously doesn't mind linoleum, which is fine, but he fails to make a case for the other options as well as he could have and should have so that the reader could make informed choices.Finally I would like to say that despite my misgivings and the problems I found, I'd like to reiterate that anyone going into building or buying a new home wouldn't be hurt by reading this book and even a simple suggestion or solution to a problem would pay for the cost of the book, but don't stop with just this book. It leaves too much out."

This book is rich with helpful, practical, and useful information on a variety of topics, including windows and doors, the electrical and non-electrical wiring, HVAC, and plumbing. The suggestions offered are straight-forward and are common sense ideas that will help anyone building a new home. Recommendations such as wiring garage door openers to an electrical switch that can be turned off while the house is vacant as a security precaution, installing a basement floor drain for high-efficiency furnaces or if a humidifier is installed, using a mixing valve to bring both hot and cold water to an outside hose bib, are just a few examples that are offered. I found the section on kitchen design/layout, countertop selection, and exhaust systems very useful, as it caused me to alter some of the design I had previously done in the construction of my home, which will prevent me from experiencing certain issues that I may have otherwise overlooked.Having built 2 homes previously and having read 4 books on this topic in the past 2 months, I can tell you without reservation that this is the most-comprehensive, organized, and easy-to-read book I have found available on this topic thus far.

This book lets me take things a step further by enabling me to pay attention to so many important details. This book has helped me see that a house's design involves more than the relationships between the rooms; it also involves the placement of various items within a room -- items such as appliances, doors, and light switches. If you are interested in house design, building a house, shopping for a house, or remodeling a house, I highly recommend this book."

0425177734,Once A Lawman,,A2JACF5E4VIV25,Tom S. Coke,5/5,4.0,976406400,Whodunnit out West?,"This book has a Montana sheriff after a killer in a small cowtown. The characters ride horses, gamble in the town's saloon, cuss, smoke &quot;quirleys&quot; and visit &quot;soiled doves.&quot; But aside from that the story takes on a different genre from the traditional Western. That's because Sheriff Ben Stillman takes on a different type of killer. &quot;Bar fights, spontaneous shootings, horse thieves, cattle rustlers, and bank robbers he could handle,&quot; the book explains. Those cases had plenty of witnesses. &quot;All Stillman had had to do was walk up, remove the smoking gun from the killers' hands, and throw the culprits in the hoosegow.&quot; This time the killer leaves no trails - no witnesses, no motive. Author Peter Brandvold spotlights one character after another; Stillman's African-American deputy, local cowboys, soldiers, the town blacksmith, the Chinese restaurant owner, a wife-abusing farmer, showing each as the possible killer. The plot thickens as one after another murder takes place and the sheriff's job comes into jeopardy. In the process Brandvold tells the story of the West the way it was, from the brothels and bars to faithful marriages (including the sheriff's). Through it all he spins a good tale, revealing just enough clues as he goes to keep your interest. You might say this is a Western murder mystery. This is the first Brandvold book I've read, but hopefully not the last. His style is direct, clear, and compelling, qualities found in all the best authors."

0387944923,Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics,,A1645DFK7GHGXX,Silme Sikil,5/5,3.0,1104624000,Confusing and Funny,"Alice in Quantumland is an entertaining novel that is sure to get the basics of quantum physics across to its readers. Gilmore teaches his readers the basics of complex concepts through lovable characters that are sure to hook his readers. While the concepts are hard to grasp without formal teaching Gilmore presents them in a way that makes it easier to understand. Characters such as the kind and lovable Quantum Mechanic or even the Classics Mechanic help to keep the readers entertained while teaching them new concepts.However, if you have never taken any type of physics course and have no background in chemistry, this book may come across as very confusing. The concepts can be very difficult to grasp. It is hard to understand how someone can be in six different places at once without having a physicist standing behind you explaining quantum physics while you read about Alice's adventures. As Gilmore explains in the Preface, ""Neils Bohr, the father figure of quantum mechanics in its early days is said to have remarked that anyone who did not feel dizzy when thinking about quantum theory had not understood it.""Yet, once the concepts are understood there is an underlying bit of humor that makes the book amusing. There are characters such as the ugly duckling, the little mermaid, and even the emperor with new clothes. Bad puns and old storybook characters appear in this book making the adventures of Alice rather humorous.As a junior in high school with two older siblings majoring in physics I recommend reading this book (provided you have some physics knowledge or siblings that can explain quantum mechanics). If you are able to understand the concepts of quantum mechanics the book is hilarious and will call you back to read it again and again."

However, those who are interested in quantum physics or just want to update their understanding of the area will probably enjoy this book. Gilmore attempts to weave a bit of the Alice adventure into the quest to keep the reader's attention while pointing out the developments of ""Quantumland,"" although Alice's allegorical involvement diminishes a bit toward the end of the book. Repetition of concepts will help younger readers to grasp key points while the inserted notes (and end notes) help to move the discussion along more technical lines. For sure, there is little of math or proofs in the book but the emphasis is upon introducing and explaining basic concepts, especially the interaction of particles. Some will find the book too simple, others a bit boring, but Gilmore does a credible job at presenting the developments and unknowns of Quantum Physics.

While Physics was not necessarily my favorite subject in school, my interest increased significantly after reading books by Feynman and others that made the subject more approachable. However, I had trouble in grasping the fundamental concepts of Quantum Mechanics even after reading some excellent books, probably due to its inherent abstract nature.However, this book changed things. The overlay of the Alice in Wonderland on top of intricacies of quantum mechanics made it a lot better read and helped me create a mental picture that was otherwise hazy. I think the use of Alice in Wonderland itself is an excellent choice, given the wacky qualities of the story which fits perfectly with the equally wacky nature of Quantum Mechanics.The author has made the complex issues in Quantum Mechanics a lot more memorable by equating it to Alice's characters and what they do.This book is intended to explain the concepts of Quantum Mechanics to a lay reader - be he well-versed in Physics or not.

However, the basic shell remains the same, as well as the vast majority of the content with the text one would purchase here.According to authors Corrigan and Hudson, `the story of religion in America is the story of many religions, some claiming large memberships, some numbering only a few followers.' It involves issues of geography, ethnography, and pluralism both comfortable and conflicting. This continues into the present time, as issues of nationalism and globalism enter into relationship with the continuing diversity of religious identity and expression in the United States.The text begins with colonial times, not simply with the various settlements in the thirteen colonies, but also in the Spanish and French arrivals dating back to 1492. It also discusses in the opening chapter the worldview of the native peoples, which is not a monolithic or unitary thing, but rather a wide range of viewpoints, practices and organisational elements perhaps outnumbering the variety within Christianity today.The authors draw in brief discussions of the situation in European Catholicism and Protestantism as they introduce the various peoples who arrive in the Americas, as their understanding and reaction to the European versions play a pivotal role in how they attempt to constitute themselves in the Western hemisphere. The various elements within English-speaking and Continental Protestantism are covered with good definition for an introductory survey.The text continues with a discussion of the Great Awakening and its influence on the increasingly independent colonies of North America, and how it contributed to the sense of communal identity and separateness that led to distinct denominationalism. The authors also look at the role of religion in politics at the time of the American Revolution as well as the attitudes of different churches toward independence. Included here is a brief discussion of the situation with regard to the unwilling immigrants who brought aspects of their own religious traditions from Africa.The second section surveys the new nation as it grows and spreads from east to west, including a strengthening and realignment of denominations, with Protestant Christian dominance more or less solidified by the Second Awakening. The authors also discuss the situation of Jewish communities now forming in America, various Utopian movements, social movements such as Abolitionism, and various new developments in the American religious landscape (Mormonism, Spiritualism, etc.).The period from the Civil War to the first world war is covered in the third section. This looks at issues dealing with north/south splits and reunifications due to the Civil War, the impact of freedom for African Americans on religious life in America, the impact of modern intellectual movements on religious thinking, and issues of the increasing urban character of the United States. Various movements here include the idea of the Social Gospel, women's issues, and missionary work both at home and abroad.The final section looks at the twentieth century from the first world war forward. Protestantism and Catholicism underwent major changes both domestically and worldwide, and many smaller groups began to grow in importance, such as Judaism and Eastern Orthodoxy (and, as the century drew to a close, other world religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam began to have a presence in the religious fabric of America).This is a relatively brief survey for such a vast topic, considering that so many Americans take religion seriously, even if not adhering to particular churches or other institutions. Even so, the numbers of people who do not identity themselves as Christian or even as religious has grown tremendously in the last decade of the twentieth century. Still, this has not lessened the increasing diversity of religious expression. `Religious diversity in America has created an environment hospitable to popular religion. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Native America religions, and other ancient traditions are visible in as assortment of American contexts and locales. Alongside them are the many younger religions that either were born on American soil or were brought here by immigrants.'The book includes a very useful index and a section of suggested readings, which could be fleshed out a bit more. There are footnotes rather than endnotes, which is a good thing, particularly given that the number of footnotes is adequate for scholarly purposes but not overbearing for the general and typical undergraduate reader. There is a small but reasonable number of maps, photographs, and other images throughout the text. The narrative itself is accessible, fairly engaging and helpful for anyone interested in the history of religion in America."

Cooper,23/25,5.0,1121299200,Fine and Wise Counsel for Artists,"This book focuses on facing the winds of change and challenge in the commitment to fostering artistic creativity. I would have preferred a *Table of Contents* in the beginning of the book which I think would be beneficial to the reader. Cameron is self revelatory in the book, honest enough, shares some deep encouragement for drought and waiting times in the creative day to day process. It is obvious that this author practices what she preaches and is writing from the heart of her own experience.The middle section of the book between P. 97 and 195 had the most personal meaning for me. Cameron's assertions encourage blooming artists to adhere to practices of discipline and wade out the rough adversarial waters which inevitably rise during the day to day artistic awakening process.The chapter on ""Remembering Who We Are"" contains a profound essential truth. On p. 182, Cameron is right on the mark when she addresses the self-sabotaging cruel voice within each human life that completely erects blocks from within and without. She states, ""Some of the finest painting gets done on the days when we just show up at the easel because that is our job. In other words, when we practice self acceptance of where we are and who we are instead of striving, always to be better. We are enough, exactly as we are."" From this essential truth, the artist is encouraged to take heart and not lose hope.Most of the writing activities at the end of each chapter are ""keep in your hip pocket"" types. You may wish to make photo copies of them and tuck them in the inside pocket of your journal to use later. I recommend just reading the book straight through. You'll have a pretty fair idea after reading the entire piece where you want to focus your time and energies. At that time, you can make copies of the *end of chapter activities* which seem most appropriate for where you are in your creative journey.On p. 213, she clearly has a handle on the essence of art, that it is a process of soul bearing and to engage this process ""requires great humility."" Art weaving and art making is a quite vulnerable endeavor. When a project is finished it is subject to receptivity, rejection or both. Commitment to the process remains the goal for budding artists whether any project received or rejected. This is often a profound challenge each artist faces. Cameron offers examples of those who remained faithful to writing, to ""art making"" while day in and day out sifting through reams of very mediocre material before the ""ah ha"" creative wonder emerged. She offers sound guidance in how to keep one's commitment on steady grounding.The chapter on ""Drama"" I found rather humorous and insightful. Cameron absolutely nails the deadly effects of ""letting the (...)"" of drama get you down. I appreciated reading how absolutely distracting this is to living the life of an artist. The beauty of her solution is to create art straight at the energy flagging dramas that run through the mind. In meditation art we learn to detach from dramas and this is helpful. In the conscious life and in work, I find it important as well to watch becoming entangled in dramatic plays and ploys that occur in any relationship. Awareness of drama magnets assists in the wise practice of detachment and getting on with the art.There is fine wisdom in ""The Sound of Paper"" for journal work and delving more deeply to one's daily artistic endeavors."

Her work, The Artist's Way changed my life. I was diligent and worked through Ms. Cameron's twelve week program several times over from beginning to end. The book, the exercises, and Ms. Cameron's method worked for me.As I talk to people about that book there were two recurring themes among those who had also discovered her work. Either they, like me, found it immensely helpful, or they started in and quickly lost interest. The second group is much larger.There are varied reasons the second group gives, but at the top of their list is the required discipline to make your way through The Artist's Way. Ms. Cameron addresses this problem in The Sound of Paper.The Sound of Paper is different. The chapters are short and the method and process aren't at the fore. This time, Ms. Cameron writes short essays from a biographical focus telling stories of her life, her failures, her fears and her successes. These short essays are lyrical snapshots of an artist's life. At the end of each essay is an exercise. For those who've skimmed, scanned or experienced her previous book, you'll notice many of the same exercises come up again. There isn't that sense of urgency about the process. Instead, the exercises are gentler and have a random feeling in their placement.While I will always recommend The Artist's Way as the life changing book that it is, The Sound of Paper is another excellent experience for those interested in discovering their artist within and letting that artist out into the world. Having choices and options is always a good thing and Ms. Cameron has delivered us choice in her latest work."

There are interesting and helpful excercises at the end of each essay. Alot of the essays stem from her 'Artist Date' experiences, and her reflections and observations. She does write about the 'Morning Pages' that she has become so well known for. Besides the Artist Dates and Morning Pages, she also highly recommends taking a 20 minute walk everyday and an hour walk at least once a week.I have revisited this several times and, although I don't think it made a big difference for me with my writing, I do enjoy and benefit from many of the essays. Mostly according to what I'm going through at the time I read or reread this book.One thing is for sure. This woman knows about the pains of life, and writing. -And she knows how to keep on living in the most creative way she can. In many parts, I found myself consoled because I could tell that she wasn't merely speculating, you can feel that it comes from her heart.This is not just for writers, but any artists. Honestly, it didn't knock my socks off, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. Do we always need for a book to be out of this world to get something valuable from it? I don't think so. This woman has already made a huge contribution to the world with her ""Artists Way."" She doesn't need to prove anything to anyone.

In ""The Sound of Paper,"" Cameron has expanded this vision, offering more exercises and examples, as well as a more personal look at her own struggles as a writer.Cameron practices what she preaches: She is an accomplished author and playwright, and the book itself is testament to her talent. Her writing appears so effortless, mere musings. Try and copy that! It's no easy task. Even after I was long done reading the book, her descriptions of the New Mexico landscape have stayed with me, inspiring me to create a little of that magic. At the very least, it makes me long for a trip to the Southwest, again a testament to the power of words so carefully crafted.What Cameron demonstrates so effectively is that to be aware of your surroundings is to make your life your art, and that is the key to it all. Of course, another part of that equation is simply doing art, without the expectation of perfection. And that perfection is a tricky thing, a common trap for artists of all stripes. In the end, what ""The Sound of Paper"" conveys is much the same as ""The Artist's Way."" However, this book moves one step closer to illustrating the lessons so clearly delineated in both books, and that is something fine indeed."

Designed for artists, writers, musicians, actors, sculptors, and anyone else whose desires lean toward the creative, Cameron's book reads similar to The Right to Write, another book of essays tailored more toward the impact writing can have on the creative life.Written during the summer months spent while living in Taos, New Mexico, Cameron begins each essay with a description of the weather, the landscape, or the culture of one of Taos, one of America's hotbeds of artistic inspiration. Cameron makes comparisons of the natural world around her to the creative lives of the individuals she seeks to help unblock. The essays are short, running on average two or three pages, and the initial paragraphs of explicit description of Taos and the weather can become frustrating after a while. Keep reading. Get past the mundane to the core of the essay, and you will find inspiring expert advice.Many of the concepts explored in The Sound of Paper are the same as in Cameron's best-selling creativity workshop, The Artist's Way. The Sound of Paper serves as outstanding supplemental reading for anyone undertaking The Artist's Way. Each essay is followed by an activity intended in helping the reader experience first-hand the concepts discussed. Cameron explores all aspects of creativity, from the root causes behind blocked artists to dealing with creative reawakening and even surrounding ourselves with supportive and encouraging friends. She takes things a step further by encouraging her readers to explore their deepest desires, imagining themselves as fulfilling their creative dreams and setting goals - both long and short term - to achieve them.Cameron discounts common stereotypes of artistic people, explaining that artists need not be loners, eccentric, alcoholic, or unhappy. So many of these stereotypes force individuals to shy away from an artistic life. Cameron explains creativity as the reason for life on earth, linking creativity to spirituality and a higher power she refers to as God, or the Great Creator. Her perspective is unique in that she asks her readers to consider themselves as conduits, or channels, tapping into the creative energy of the universe and bringing art to life. Cameron encourages the removal of the ego in the process of making art.A worthwhile and inspiring book for anyone seeking to get in touch with their creativity, The Sound of Paper will challenge readers to go outside of their comfort zone and take a chance on implementing a happier, more fulfilling existence. Aside from the often too details prose regarding New Mexico and the stretching comparisons, the book is filled with solid advice and inspirational stories of creative awakening."

The text is well-written, albeit there is absolutely nothing new here; as in The Artist's Way Cameron continually pats herself on the back and drops names. The Sound of Paper should be renamed 'The Sound of Money' as it is definitely funding the author's less lucrative creative projects by tapping into her cash cow."

It seems to me that the author spends all her time writing books on how to write/be creative - without having produced much else at all. A really good writer writes books and maybe, just maybe, will write one guide to aspiring writers. I have not read any of Cameron's other works but the writing in this one is not a good advertisement for her at all. Her short 'essays' - presented to the would-be-creative-writer whose muse has gone on vacation are meant to be inspirational. I find them pedestrian at best; shallow and uni-dimensional in content and bristling with the shabbiest of clich&eacute;s. An insult to anyone dedicated to meaningful, resolved writing. These short essays act as a prelude to a simple 'exercise' aimed at about Grade 5 level ( I am judging by what my children received at school here in Namibia at age about 10) which is meant to release one's creative spirit. To say that the book is steeped in mediocrity is almost too generous. I cannot recommend this to anyone who is serious about writing or accessing their creative spirit unless they are a teacher of pre-pubescent children."

Simon is a smart killer, sophisticated, and plans his fear games to the last detail. He is also rich and can spend full time exploring this deadly activity.Enter Special Agent Pender, a large, witty and terribly dressed veteran of the FBI on the verge of his retirement. Pender is a likable fellow - he drinks too much, a live-alone divorcee, at the end of a long career. But appearances can be deceiving because this roly-poly officer of the law has been chasing serial killers for twenty years and knows how they think.Dorie Bell is a middle-aged artist with an unusual phobia - prosoponophobia, fear of masks. Simon has her in his reptilian sights and when she least expects it, he strikes and his malevolent activities begin.Nasaw writes his descriptions realistically and effortlessly. He's a visual writer, placing the reader directly into his scenes. As you turn the pages of this novel, the images of Simon's sadistic games appear before your eyes - Nasaw is a fly-on-the-wall- writer, which makes this kind of story that much more enjoyable.As a fan of this genre, I'm intrigued how so many good writers out there can continue to come up with new spins on the ways and methods of the serial killer; Nasaw certainly ranks with the best of them.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""",4/4,5.0,1048636800,Terrific thriller and one of the nastiest villains ever.,"""Fear Itself,"" by Jonathan Nasaw, stands out from other serial killer novels. Nasaw combines whimsical humor and terror expertly, without either element throwing the novel out of balance. His villain is an incredibly cold and malicious individual; yet, Nasaw fleshes out the murderer's personality so that we understand how he became so monstrous. All of this is packaged in a fast-moving, incredibly exciting and suspenseful story.An unknown assailant is targeting a group of people who suffer from specific phobia disorders (fear of heights, snakes, drowning and masks are some examples). The killer makes the murders appear to be suicides, but one individual, a phobic herself named Dorrie Bell, suspects that these were no suicides. For example, an acrophobic (a person who fears high places) apparently jumped out of a twelfth-story window. Dorrie doesn't buy it.Two unlikely candidates decide to help Dorrie find the out the truth. One is E. L. Pender, an overweight, fifty-six year old Special Agent of the FBI. Although Pender is on the brink of retirement, he cannot resist getting involved in one more case. The other is Linda Abruzzi, a thirty-five year old woman with a disability. Abruzzi stubbornly refuses to leave the FBI, even though her superiors have made it clear that they no longer value her services.Abruzzi and Pender use their considerable skills to track their adversary, who is clever, ruthless and very dangerous. Nasaw ratchets up the tension almost unbearably as the book progresses. The scenes in which the killer confronts the phobics with what they fear most are not for the faint-hearted.The dialogue and plotting in ""Fear Itself"" is terrific and the novel is perfectly paced. Nasaw depicts all of the characters, both major and minor, with care and they all contribute to the complex story. The author provides fascinating background information on phobia disorders, which helps the reader to understand and empathize with the plight of the victims. If you have a strong stomach, if you like nasty villains, and if enjoy a dose of both humor and horror with your suspense, pick up ""Fear Itself."" Just be sure to leave the light on."

The hero, E.L. Pender, continues to be an unconventional hero, overweight, balding, and not someone who stepped out of GQ. His replacement, Linda Abbruzzi, is likewise likeable, considering she has a life threatening disease and the FBI doesn't want her around. Add phobic Dorie Bell as a mask-fearing heroine, and you've got the setup for a tasty thriller.Unfortunately, the sum is not as good as the parts. The villain, Simon Child, is nasty enough, and his relationship with his Down Syndrome sister Missy, is touching, yet repulsive. What hurts the book, I think, is that instead of a tense whodunit, it becames an example of police procedural, and let's see how long we can keep these people tucked away in the basement. Pender's romance with Dorie sometimes gets in the way of the action. Child's reunion with his childhood buddy Nelson Carpenter, is also drawn out to the point of losing its momentum. Although the deaths we share are gruesome and nerve-wracking, they are so coldly presented, they manage to lose some of their impact.And Nasaw missed a great opportunity to finish off his villain. Way late in the book, Dorie remembers what Simon is afraid of--after all, they met a convention for phobics, which he put together to suit his dastardly purpose. Why didn't Nasaw use this fear in the end?Oh well, I don't mean to sound too negative.It's a good book that could have been better.RECOMMENDED."

B0002YECNU,Fear Itself : A Novel,,,,1/1,4.0,1066262400,Refreshing,"I liked this book just because it was different from every other serial killer/psychological thriller/FBI book out there - and there are a whole lot of those! Our hero was not fresh out of the academy, gorgeous, athletic and brilliant. He was overweight, old and made mistakes. He was feisty enough to become endearing, though. The female lead was not a Clarice Starling clone, she had MS and was deskbound! The book does not have a happy ending and that was just stunning to me after years of reading the same old plots and having them neatly wrapped up at the end, in a manner that surely does not happen in real life. The story unfolds in an unusual manner because the killer is revealed like four minutes into the story, but there's still plenty of book left and it doesn't turn out to be a letdown that you already know whodunnit. In addition, you learn some new things about phobias after reading this book. There are some nasty deaths in here, but not so gory that you have to skip paragraphs to get back to the story. And there's no detailed sex! Could be a drawback for some, but personally, if I wanted to read that, I wouldn't have picked up a novel. The phobia killings were an interesting hook but I only gave it four stars because the book wasn't intriguing enough to keep me running back for more. It's worth a read just to experience something different in fiction for a change."

Pender is great fun (I wish we had more of Sid, the wise cracking, dapper best friend to Ed), but we don't get even get as much of him. Linda is a decent character, who is not fleshed out. We get a lot of Simon Childs (not real clever with that name, but oh well), who is fascinating in theory, but only fairly interesting in reality. I would have liked more Pender. The book is good in that it does not dwell too long on any one chase (as the last book did at times). The last one worked for pure scare factor, this was more fun, but there are many better thrillers out there. Oh, and why is Nasaw always trying to show us that he must have scored well on his Verbal SATs? I wonder what he is trying to overcompensate for. Still, I'd welcome another Pender novel, but I hope he enjoys his retirement first."

I had put this book down several times and it was shear stubbornness that I made myself finish it. Revealing the killer in the first quarter of the book lost my interest.I experimented in reading the remaining chapters by skipping all sections that had reference to the killer 'Simon'and a really obscure section dealing with his sister. This did not present any problems in following the storyline. I have read many thriller stories dealing with FBI investigations and this had to be the sloppiest. Skipping sections of the book sped up the reading considerably and shortened the story, thankfully.If this killer was using 'fear', it was a poor attempt. Just pick anyone off the street and torture them, you'll get the same results. I really want to give this one star, I'm just sorry that I spent the time finishing it."

And it is, it really is. But that's where the great part ended.The writing style was pretty much average for this type of novel. The ideas behind some of the characters were really good, original, potentially interesting, but that's again where it ended. In the idea stage. When it came time to develop, things began to unravel, and then, to rather promptly fall flat. With many years of experience behind him, and retirment in the offing, the main? FBI agent character suddenly goes brain dead, and forgets how to behave like a professional. Instead, he nearly gets one of the victims killed. I didn't buy that anyone with that vast a field of experience, attracted to a witness or no, would suddenly get that stupid. It frankly reeked of agism. Oh yes, and poor characterization.The other partial, Persecuted due to disability, mostly former agent with MS, again, potentially a good character, also continues to hang, fall flat, etc. What she's even doing there is often questionable. Were it not, again, this might also be quite good. The author does have a real sensitivity, on some levels, to the plight of the disabled. Perhaps he should have stayed there.The sister of the killer has downs syndrome. The Killer, who is far too soon revealed, and long before he could really get down to thinking up ever more horrendous ways in which to off his poor victims, frankly what one would expect, considering the idea, yet again, manages to fall flat.Of all the characters, the sister is the one I actually liked best. Her ultimate disposition, however, felt so contrived as to be ridiculous, lead-ins for it, or no. Too, within this story line, there are places he started to go, then didn't. Rather a tendency toward tangents, that, indeed, I found running throughout the work.The other character I liked was the phobic female artist. Having found, only halfway through the book, however, what her fate would be, I set the thing aside. Every now and then, I picked it up, thereafter, to slog on through, having paid full price for the paperback, and hoping it would get better. No such luck. The villain, who goes on the run, looks up old chums, etc., just doesn't manage to overcome the yawning.Perhaps the author's other works are better. If ever I'd be inclined to find out, I'd do it at the library."

She has just been diagnosed with MS and instead of her supervisors supporting her and helping her with medicaldisability they want her to quit. As she is organizing her new desk she comes across a letter from Dorie who thinks her friends are being murdered by a killer who is using their fears against them. The police reports all point to accidental or suicidal deaths but Linda feels in her gut that this letter is legitimate. After confirming Dorie's story and reviewing the case files it is determined that a stalker is terrorizing people who have phobias. After getting Pender to hang around unofficially on the case and convincing the bosses to set up a task force the story goes south. At this time I get tired of the mini chapters inside each chapter that pulls the plot apart and makes it very difficult to follow the train of thought of the book. Nasaw also compromises the integrity of the case by having too many characters get emotionally attach to the case the ending was forced instead of a smooth conclusion like he did in Girls He Adored."

The writer didn't seem to put a lot of thought in these 2 books. All i can say is don't waste your money. Ms Johnson didn't seem to care when she was writing these books. It is so unfair to the readers.

The history lesson was good but I struggled to finish the story. The main characters were likeable but I was never convinced that them ending up together would be a good thing. I had a very hard time buying into the whole storyline.

I wish I'd read some of the reviews before I shelled out my money.Here's my advice: Don't bother with this book if you're looking for an interesting hero, worthy of a strong heroine's love - the hero is an 18 year old Scottish Donald Trump (the Donald's money AND attitude toward women!). Don't bother with this book if you like to read stories where the main characters actually spend time together - they spend as much time apart as together with just a few love scenes. And please don't bother with this book if you enjoyed Ms. Johnson's sexy love scenes from Sinful, Wicked, or Blaze - you won't find enough here to make it worth reading. I suggest you re-read Sinful for the best of Ms. Johnson."

I liked the story and the character of Roxanne, I wish there would have been more of a story between Robbie and Roxanne. Ms. Johnson is known for her great and erotic love scenes, and I wish there were more in this book! This is definitely a step up from the last two books she wrote.

I guess this book belongs in a series and all the interesting things happened before this book started. I missed seeing the heroes falling in love. I had a feeling I was dropped in the middle of the story without knowing what happened and who is who. Well, after I sorted out who is who, I t got worse. OMG. The hero is a 18 year old whelp who thinks he is invincible and immortal and can do no wrong. Come on! Well, I know that back then people grew up earlier, but anyway. And the heroine was at least 10 years older then the hero. I might be stereotypical, but I really didn't like it. And she had far too much baggage. Five children??? Come on! Wouldn't two or three be enough? And two ex-husbands? Is there anything more you can find? It was simply too much. An as if that wasn't enough the heroine couldn't decide what she wanted. She loved him one moment, hated the next, accepted one moment, rejected the next. Made him beg again and again and again. It's OK if the hero has to grovel a bit, but not so much that he doesn't have any dignity left! Especially if he didn't really do anything wrong. The heroine simply blamed him for all the troubles and made him a scape-goat for all her mistakes and misfortunes. I don't know what they saw in each other. Except for sex. I do not recommend this book."

I personally like the reverse May-December romance ( maybe because I'm the December end) and I think that strengthens the minority opinion that Mature women can indeed still hold an enormous sex appeal. Reading this book has spurred me on to order OUTLAW to get more of the history of these very intriguing characters.

Once again Ms. Johnson has created a romance reader's dream. The story line is full of intrigue and adventure. There are moments of humor and plenty of love and sex. The main characters, Roxane and Robbie, are in love BUT are fighting an uphill battle as they deal with the turmoil surrounding Scotland's bid to not be governed by England. Of course, Ms. Johnson inlcudes footnotes, granting us a very acute BUT easy to handle amount of Scottish history. I recommend this book BUT do not paint it as her best. The tension between the characters at times was tedious...too much petty jealousy BUT in the end they do end up happy...which was well worth the effort to finish this book. I am a big fan of Ms. Johnson and encourage romance lovers to pick up a copy of this book."
0553578669,To Please a Lady,7.99,,,3/5,4.0,974505600,I liked this book...,"Sure, Robbie is only 18,but this is not a contemporary setting. I don't know why everyone is making such a big deal of this...I haven't been reading romance very long but it seems that in many historical romances the woman is much younger than the man. So the positions are reversed here. He is not an 18 year old of today either. He is very powerful and very wealthy. I liked the conversation too..a lot was very humorous. Haven't read Susan Johnson before so I can't say if this is better or worse than her others. I found it enjoyable with just a few questions. What's with all the footnotes? Do I really care about detail here? I didn't check any of them. It's a romance novel. This is all in fun..nothing serious about it. Also, some of the conversation was questionable. Did they really use those words back then? I don't really care. I liked it and found it very entertaining!!"
0553578669,To Please a Lady,7.99,,,1/2,5.0,937267200,An excellent erotic romance,"In 1705, the outlawed Earl of Greenlaw returns from Holland to Edinburgh. Robbie Carre plans to claim the decade-plus older Countess of Kilmarnok as his and to reclaim the estate stolen from him. Roxane Forrester has survived marriages, childbirth, politics, and the machinations of Scotland-s most powerful individuals. Yet the thirty- plus-year-old beauty cannot resist the charming Robbie whom she watched grow from boy to man.Robbie's enemies will use anyone as bait to capture the insolent lad. The Duke of Queensbury thinks Roxane is the perfect lure to capture Robbie. To gain her cooperation, he will use her beloved children as blackmailing tool. To protect her children (including Robbie) even from her deceased husband's family, Roxane turns away from her lover to another powerful noble. However, she failed to factor in the fact that Robbie's love for her will impel him to risk everything to gain Roxane by his side.TO PLEASE A LADY is a daring, unique and well-written story that will please many of the author's fans, but shock others. Roxane is a wonderful character whose bravery seems inspiring. Robbie was a charmer in his previous appearance. However, in this novel, he seems more like a recalcitrant teenager than a loving hero, which in turn hurts the romance between him and his older beloved. The secondary cast adds a feel of intrigue with their plots, counterplots, and double crossing. Susan Johnson heats up Scotland with this fast-paced historical romance."
0553578669,To Please a Lady,7.99,AN09PKOVPZWA8,J. Brennan,0/1,4.0,1126656000,Great follow-up to Outlaw!,"The only reason not 5 stars is Robbies age. Since I have boys this young I have a problem -even knowing that times were different that Robbie only 18 could have been quite the man of the world, nor had so many sexual experiences. He was written to seem older, naturally so his exploits were believable to a reader, but not when I thought about it rationally. Baring that - I truly thought this was one of Johnson's better more complete love stories. Although I like her sex scenes that are hot and heavy, this book seemed to rely more on a truly intense, long term depth of caring. Roxanne had loved only once before in her life - her first husband that she had 5 children by. She was a very independent woman, and Robbie was a very commanding presence in her life. She fought this commanding way of his, but in the end it was really the kind of man she needed and wanted. He fought hard for her. I do not understand those that felt he acted immaturely - he may have been young but I thought he acted quite honorably. Actually at times it seemed that Roxanne was more the rouge - she seemed to have quite a sexual past as well - and I did not always understand why she kept throwing Robbies in his face. The political intrigue while a backdrop to the love story was interesting, for me it was just a backdrop. It was much more exciting watching the Carre brothers in action - and to see Robbie fight for the love of his young life. I really think this is a great Susan Johnson book and would be a must buy for a Johnson lover - also to follow up on the Outlaw book - which was in itself a true 5 star read!"

(yech!) I would prefer youth,stamina and virility in a man rather than old age.I guess a woman with 5 children isn't supposed to have asex drive or enjoy pleasure, much less even have a sex life?Society still doesn't accept that women can have a strongsex drive and enjoy their lifes even after they become amother or after they reach a certain age perhaps?!?And by the way, I don't think the reader from Colorado evenread the book.... or perhaps she is dyslexic??The 18 year old man was panting after and chasing and pursuingthe older woman, *not* the other way around. The woman in thebook is a beautiful woman with several powerful men who arefighting and vying for her attention, hardly some desperatewoman chasing a young man, she was resisting his advancesactually.Personally, I enjoyed the fantasy of a woman who had severalchoices of men who were all lusting after and fighting overher and who enjoys a sex life with a man younger than her.Must we be such prudes or so incest phobic that we can'teven enjoy a fantasy about sex with a handsome younger man?!?Quite sad, if even ones fantasies have to be sexually repressed!"

She did her usual historical homework, but even that seemed contrived to me. It seemed as if she had to keep up with her previous books by putting in endnotes, so let's find some information that might fit the time period. If they shrunk the typesetting and moved the margins outward, where her previous books were printed, I don't think this story would fill 175 pages. When I finished the book, I couldn't believe that was it, where was the rest of it? Argyll gave up way to easily, even if he was greedy. What of Queensbury? He just disappeared. Sometimes I had trouble believing that Robbie was actually 18. At other times he was the epitome of the horny 18 year old. Unfortunately, he was very difficult to take seriously.

This one, I will personally vouchsafe, is impeccably clean. I did not quite get what the danger in the book was all about , because Roxanne had to be shut up in some house in the beginning for a very long time. Robbie is more of a whining teenage boy, if that's the type of lover you prefer. Also, Roxanne has kids, which kind of diminished the exciting factor of romance novels. The lead antagonist is Argyll who lusts for Roxanne, but he gets vanished after a few chapters, though it would have been nice if he reappeared to show some consistency. Too clean and too boring"

It's not worth hiding the bad and unpleasant side of the group, especially during the Hamburg-period and during the world-tours in 65-66. They weren't angels at all and sometimes it is very illuminating to know the negative side of their character, for instance when you would like to understand the lyrics of the songs. This book isn't critical at all and for a great biography it is claimed to be critical and therefore well-balanced. It's worth reading but you have to know that this is a kind of fairy-tale."

A chapter describing the writing and recording of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends,&quot; &quot;Getting Better,&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; offers unique and especially valuable glimpses of the Beatles at work. Chapters depicting the home life and personal outlook of each Beatle are also very interesting. I must also say that for an authorised biography, this is remarkably honest.

Davies manages to ellicit some great anecdotes from people who were closest to The Beatles. Mimi, Paul's dad, the Harrisons, close friends, Fred Lennon (John's dad), Pete Best; they all get to have their say. The book is especially strong during the Hamburg years (loosely 59-62). Davies captures the growth in their popularity, attracting interesting characters along the way, yet having no fan base outside Liverpool and Hamburg. He demonstrates so vividly the growing desperation of the boys to make it big. Once the rollercoaster took off then the book is on trickier ground. Davies clearly wants to divulge stuff which The Beatles were not keen on him revealing (Davies was writing the book during 1967/early 68). For instance, Lennon was heavily into drugs at this time and Hunter Davies refers to John as being in a daze. Yes, you have to read between the lines! One of the strengths of this book is its matter-of-fact delivery. Although Davies is clearly a fan he still keeps his feet on the ground. The death of Brian Epstein is well-handled. Remember, this was written before all the Klein, Apple, Ono nonsense hit the fan. Yet Davies manages to convey a growing sense of isolation amongst the group. His pen-portraits of each member is uncannily (eerily) accurate, bearing in mind the general public thought The Beatles were a rock-solid national institution. The book is a cracker and loses a star of its rating only because of a rather mysterious lack of detail around Rubber Soul and Revolver. The rest is gear!"

When Hunter Davies first interviewed the Beatles for this book from 1967-1968, it was before all the bickering and fighting started and before Yoko came into the picture. Davies takes an inside look in thier home and family life, the songwriting process, and recording sessions. It also gives a pretty good background on their childhoods and how they all met. Not to mention a lot of great pictures, including some I never seen before. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it is not a totally definative bio. Lots of things were left out because it upset thier family members. For example, it is not mentioned that Brian Epstein was homosexual because it upset his mother at the time. And some things were left out of John's childhood because it upset his aunt Mimi. Other than that, I reccomend that you read this book. It is smart and thouroughly researched.

It may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the Mark Lewishon-type of books, but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band. Hunter Davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today's writers - because they weren't there. The chapter that describes them writing 'With A Little Help From My Friends', for example, is as amusing as it is amazing. And I very much enjoyed the prologue, where Davies explains the difficulties he had with Queenie Epstein and Aunt Mimi. And his meeting with Pete Best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a Beatles book. It is stories like those that make the book worth buying."

Plus a few notes on why the biographies aren't as complete as current ones. Everyone involved back in the day wanted certain negative bits removed (John's auntie Mimi was SICK with worry over John's childhood memories coming off too wicked or bad.

It's fun to read--not because you will discover anything new about The Beatles.This book is a time capsule of the type of book you'd read in the 60s that wasn't written to embarrass it's subjects. It's how The Beatles wanted their fans to view their lives--as ""normal"" working guys with wives and kids! The Beatles were music visionaries but they did not foresee the future of tabloid publishing where all-things-Beatle would be exposed by anyone who came in contact with them because it is a cash cow. Mr. Davis updated the orginial book with his later experiences with the Beatles up to 1985 in my version.Those updates start to reflect the current ""tell all"" bios. The most famous story in the updates, is a recounting of Paul calling Mr. Davis in 1981 and ranting about things Yoko said about him (Paul) after John's death -- exposing Paul's insecurities and (I thought) his obvious grief over John's death. It is hard to believe after all The Beatles have accomplished that anyone of them could be insecure but that is one of the themes of this book. They are after all, human and Mr. Davies succeeds in showing that side of them."

The later editions have a section about the breakup, what they did individually in the 1970's, the tragedy of John Lennon in 1980 and more recent interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo.

Because it was actually written while the Beatles were together, and because Davies had first hand access to the Boys, this book has a certain charm that makes it worthwhile. The style is intimate, lighthearted, and easy-going.What sticks in my head when I read this book is the fact that it was written before the bitter breakup. Granted, the White Album era had its tensions (though these are not discussed in this book, a tasteful decision) but because this book doesn't have to end with ""and then they broke up"" it exists like a strange time capsule. In this book the Beatles will be together forever, good friends, jamming in the studio and enjoying a legendary camaraderie.That's not to say that this book is a lie...it just focuses on the positive aspects of the relationship that existed between those four guys. And because Davies had first hand access to the Beatles while writing it he was around for some very intimate, personal moments. Reading this book is the equivalent of being at a party with the Beatles and having the bonus of them all being in good moods.Now, at heart this is a Beatles history book. It's not the best in this respect, even though the author had such great access to the Beatles, largely because the material is too glossy and PR oriented to be relied upon as the sole source of ones Beatle knowledge. It's like looking at the Beatles phenomenon through rose-colored glasses; not that seeing the Beatles ""warts and all"" is so great, just more balanced.Still, even though the Beatles had to ""approve"" this book before publication (resulting in a little fab censorship, I suspect) I think it is worth a read. The style is so casual and conversational that the text flows smoothly, and I can guarantee it won't be like any other Beatles history you've seen. This book is less academic and more accessible. It was not created to be comprehensive, but rather readable.Just like Mikey used to say about Life cereal ""try it, you'll like it.""

Davies was asked by Harrison not to print certain details, and an aunt suggested he revise some of the account of John's early life to make it sound better. Some details couldn't be divulged at the time, such as Brian Epstein's gay orientation, and the extent to which John was into drugs, although you get a sense of this from some brief passages in the book although Davies obviously avoids dwelling for too long on these issues. Still, despite glossing over a few negatives like these, Davies nevertheless had access to information that no other writer had, and no doubt the book benefits from that despite its being slightly sanitized.One thing that distinguises this book from all the other bios is Davies spent a year living and travelling with the Beatles and observing them in their day-to-day lives. The year was 1967, and although the group was soon to break-up, 1967 was still a great year for the band and Davies gives many fine insights and details into the life of the group during this period. Davies enlivens the account with anecdotes and stories from many relatives and friends who knew the Beatles best.I want to take a brief detour here to tell you about a funny piece of Beatles trivia I discovered recently, and I just have to mention it here, since I don't recall seeing it in the book. Supposedly The Beatles loved cartoons, and a friend of mine who is a big Beatles fan and trivia buff and I got to talking about it, and since I'm sort of a trivia nut myself, he suggested an unlikely cartoon, which was Popeye the Sailor, and challenged me to find a connection to the Beatles. Well, it's not known if this was a cartoon the Beatles liked or not, but after doing only about an hour of research on the web, I came up with a funny but true connection.I found out one of the songs the Beatles often performed during their Hamburg years, before they were writing all their own songs, was ""Falling in Love Again,"" by Sammy Lerner, an important songwriter of the 40s and 50s. But it so happens that Lerner also was enlisted to write the theme song for the Popeye the Sailor cartoon, which he did. So it turns out that there is indeed a connection between the Beatles and Popeye in that Lerner composed songs for, shall we say, both groups of singers. :-)Anyway, I hope you didn't mind my little digression, but getting back to the book, this is a fine biography of the Beatles and is especially strong in its treatment of their early years and rise to fame. Although updated in the later edition, there isn't as much information about the post-1970 years, but as others have pointed out about the book, it's about the famous band's rise, not about their fall."

Many, if not most, are carefully refined maxims learnt from a long career practicing at law. I am not a lawyer, but a great many of the lessons that &quot;a good lawyer&quot; learns apply perhaps even more to everyday life. In addition, Cominskey's clear commitment to good old-fashioned ethics, often epitomized by the military codes he quotes, give the work a heavy measure of credibility.The key to most of the rules is that they provide a ruthlessly clear standard for living. For instance, &quot;Remember The Alamo/The Attorney-Client Privilege. Is there a 'need to know?' Loose lips sink ships.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Never expect anyone to keep a secret. If you are sharing something with them, then expect that they will likewise share it with others.&quot; And, a final example,&quot;In the practice of law You have no friends, Only opponents and potential opponents. Forewarned is forearmed.&quot;The discerning reader will find himself applying some of this unequivocal wisdom to daily life. Keep your secrets. Be respected. Work hard. Be careful, put your interests first. By stating these guidelines that lawyers (those who survive, anyway) learn in their first few years, Cominskey provides anyone with a &quot;little Bible&quot; that will seldom mislead.If the legal profession lived up to the clear, moral ethics in this book, our society (of which, by the way, &quot;lawyers are the custodians&quot;) would work seamlessly and justly. But if we can't have that quite yet, perhaps we might be able to enhance our own lives with the simple secrets of life that &quot;A Good Lawyer&quot; learns.(Cominskey's book gets four stars for clarity, integrity and usefulness.

In this volume, she shows herself to be equally at home with the urban and scientific.The poem she uses as a &quot;forepiece&quot; well illustrates her style: &quot;when the dark birds fly over / we stand and wave our arms / no don't come down here / meanwhile the birds / say look they need us / and we almost flew right by&quot;.The collection ranges over the shroud of Turin, horse training, heart arrhythmia, WW II, a history of Ireland, an urban psalm ... through it all one senses a gentle, socially conscience, spiritual alive poet.If you enjoy contemporary poetry, Jody Aliesan's work is worth noting."
B0000CO5AV,The Dead Seagull,,,,9/10,5.0,915062400,Tour de Force,"Dead Seagull is a primal tour de force by author G.Barker . The story is a 1st person meta narrative concerning his meeting with the poetess Elizabeth Smart, the subsequent abandoment of his then pregnant wife, and so on. Dead Seagull is one of those odd, pratically unknown books that will strike you mercilessly with its unparalleled poetic pyrotechniques , relentless and uncompromised honesty,all written with the hand of a masterpoet in a state of delirium. Barker is truly one of the unknown poetic giants of 20th century English prose, (as well , the poetess Elizabeth Smart, who is the focus of Dead Seagull). Why was a talent of this stature passed over by the general reading public? Perhaps the reason is that while much of Barkers poetic and literary technique follows the conventional metre of the period, his obsevations and expression are purely individual, and beholding to no-one, on a topic where society demands a rigourous attention to conventionality. READ THIS BOOK. Also read this novels subject, Elizabeth Smart's equally dazzling 'BY GRAND CENTRAL STATION I LAY DOWN AND WEPT'. You will be astounded that these works are not central to any discussion of mid 20th century poetic literature. The surpise and curiousness that works of this calibre, on par with any ot the great or greatest literature of the modern age, can lay pratically unknown beneath the waters of the general top 20 newspaper book lists, will only be surpassed by your amazement of the blinding talent suggested by this novel, and E.Smarts corresponding novel (incidently, as Barker scrys Smart and her mythological element, so scrys Smart...these two novels are as convenient as they are breathtaking). As you may probably have guessed, i cannot recomment these novels enough. In fact they would be in the top ten of all novels i would recommend concerning mid 20th century literature. BUY THIS BOOK (if you enjoy great books of unparalled mastery)"
B0000CO5AV,The Dead Seagull,,A3TVP6Y54FI35L,"Severian ""Severian""",0/0,5.0,1329350400,Superb,"George Barker is a poet of the highest order. His novel the Dead Seagull brings to mind all the things that make good writer great: Fierce intellect, vivid imagery, a distinct and unparallelled criticism on the very nature of love and its long lasting effects on the human soul, and a self-deprecating narrative that reminds one of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground. The language is effortless, confident, and a thing of sheer beauty. Anyone concerned with becoming a writer must make The Dead Seagull an essential prerequisite. Elizabeth Smart whose By Grand Central Station I Sat down and wept is also an amazing and perhaps opposing perspective on several of the most imperative aspects of the human condition such as remorse, survival, and ultimately Love. Together these masterpieces make a pair of near cosmic importance. I find it purely criminal that some of the most amazing writers and poets are conscripted to a near legionary languish that is only defeated by those weapons known by most as Ignorance and Anonymity...To recapitulate: George Barker, interpersonal relations aside, is a wordsmith to be venerated...and feared."

Though he lost his father during the sinking, he and his mother did eventually make it to Michigan to live near his relatives to whom they were en route when the disaster struck. Many years later, Mr. Goldsmith took the time to write down his memories of being on the Titanic and his impressions of what happened during that fateful night. Also included in this slim book are several photos of people who Mr. Goldsmith knew from the sinking, as well as much correspondence showing what happened to not only his mother and her friends, but how the American people, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army (but not the White Star line) came to their aid.Mr. Goldsmith did not pretend to be an author, but his dedication in sharing his first-hand account is actually well written. Though many of the details were either forgotten or glossed over, this book is indeed a treasure for anyone who is at all interested in learning more about the disaster and its aftermath. Published through the Titanic Historical Society, this is a gem and should be a part of any serious Titanic buff's collection."

It is a thin, blue book, that has a painting of the Titanic sailing away from Southampton. This book is a reprinting of the, out of print, ""Echoes in the Night"".As for my review, this book is very interesting. From what I hear, it's the ONLY book written from a child in third class. It has an interesting description of the lifeboat & lowering, as well as the sinking of the Titanic. I've looked over the book many times and am very amused when I look it over.If your like me, and are trying desperately to find a copy of ""Echoes in the Night"", my best guess it to purchase this new edition for now. Still keep looking. 2 years ago, a used copy appeared on ebay and sold for almost $400! I'm sure there are some copies out there that are for sale. Good luck!"

Presented asrecipes with short descriptions of of underlying mechanisms (usually).What caught my eye was the number of classic demonstrations common inolder books but now largely dropped from children's texts as toodangerous in ingredients required, or fumes and energy relesed.Many of the recipes are about buring or blowing up things (Yeah! ;-)* sugar cube treasted with conc H2SO4 black thing* zinc based powder that emits green smoke when spat on(thanks for teaching me this one Max ;-)* colored fire powders* flour cannon (did not mention that old quaker oats tin useful here.)I am in favor of teaching children how to safely perform dangerousscience experiments, as this is the only way to learn to do suchthings properly, (since many will do them regardless) and anyway thekids would be up to more hazardous pursuits if the modest risks of thelaboaratory are denied. If today's young people do not learn how toplay with fire safely, where will we get tommorws homeland defensetechnologists to fight our nations Fovever War against religousfanatics?However I would not encourage experimemnts involving the burning ofmercury compounds (see the blue fire formula) and the use ofcarcinogenic, flamable or persistently toxic substances like CCl4 orfluid mercury anywhere but in a proper fireproof ventilation hood.The book does mark experiments involving toxic (like CCl4)sponateously combustible (white phosphorous!) and powwerful oxidizingagents (my fav: Potassium Clorate).

In today's dummied down, Lawyer stiffled society it's nice to know that there are actually still books around that have experiments that are as fun as they are politically incorrect. All kids should be exposed to the fun of making fireworks, playing with mineral acids and white phosphorus, oxidizers, and burning metals if they can find the materials and if they have appropriate supervision. It's the real way to become introduced to non watered-down chemistry; this book has the really FUN experiments that will, unlike almost all of the prevailing experimemts in the prevailing contemporary books, keep kids from thinking that science is a complete bore. (Tri ess Sciences in Glendale, CA sells a lot of these reagents to adults).

What was frustrating reading the book is that the too few examples and anecdotes don't really clarify and strengthen the author's arguments. As a clinical psychiatrist John Ratey uses real-life examples, but often these individuals suffered from so many issues that Ratey's narrative and diagnosis felt too simple and lame. Moreover, Ratey could have explained real world applications for his insights and explanation of the way the mind works. In the last chapter, he does offer constructive advice (exercise, be passionate about what you do, etc.), but by then the advices feels trite and not relevant. Some of Ratey's suggestions - have babies listen to Mozart -- are not grounded in scientific fact. His suggestion that children who are exposed to more vocabulary do better in school shows his sometimes sloppy, unscientific reasoning (scientists know that stimuli is like vitamins - you need a certain amount of it, but too much of it will do you no good).The book was first published in 2002, and since then many better neuroscience books have entered the market. Two books I strongly suggest are ""The Accidental Mind"" and ""The Female Brain."""

And they were freaking interesting. Did you know, that the reason why americans advertise ICE COLD beer is because they wanted to numb your taste buds so that the beer would taste good? Warm beer sucks, doesn't it? Did you know, that things with motion need brains? That's why there's this squid, that has a brain and vertebrae when it is younger and in a tadpole state. Once it matures and attaches itself to something, it quits moving and self digests it's own brain. This book is filled to the brim with facts. It shows, through plenty of real life examples, plenty about specific parts about the brain. And as the title states, it really is a users guide to the brain.

Dann ""adhdmom""",5/6,5.0,1031875200,Enticing Tidbits,"The 'tidbits' were well worth the read. Perception as a reward and the nature of that process is covered in detail. Though there is no 'alcohol' gene, there has been research that implicates an area in the brain called the nucleus accumbens. Scientists label the low dopamine condition in alcoholics, ADHD, Tourettes and OCD as 'reward deficiency syndrome.' As such we come closer to understanding and treating compulsive drinking, speeding and other drug addictions. AA's have always said that certain people are born ""a pint short,"" and the current theories substantiate that metaphor.The taste sense, we are told, is highly dependent on smell and the taste buds are within the realm of evolutionary biology. They enabled survival because they inform the condition of the food. Bitter, for example, tells whether the food is rotten and if, therefore, it could sicken and kill the eater. Sound and vision are more interrelated than is commonly considered- try playing ping pong without hearing the sounds that name the game.The other areas of the book, the theaters of the mind, etc. were less striking for me, but also important to anyone attempting to integrate all of these findings into their own conceptual meaning. The last part on nourishment and exercise as integral to maintaining the physique of the mind is also repetitive but validating to all the admonishments to exercise and eat well. Ratey's book is clear, informed and worthwhile. It lacks what I found impressive in LeDoux's The Emotional Brain, and that is a theme that runs almost like an uncovering, a plot, that was true but spellbinding. Still, the 'tidbits' were new to this reader at least and as such, I will reread this volume, perhaps several times."

The first, 'use it or lose it' is familiar to most people. The second, that virtually everything the brain does can be related to bodily motion, is intriguing, and is supported by example and analogy. Sadly, it is supported in this book by little else. There is no documentation included here, and Ratey frequently makes important statements without supporting them with examples or research. Regardless of the quality of the ideas, this makes much of the book suspect.In the introduction, Ratey writes:&quot;Although metaphor and analogy are unconventional in scietific circles, I am firmly convinced that a more nonlinear kind of thought will eventually supplant much of the logical reasoning we use today...Our troubled world, too, is becoming too complex for logical argumentation, and may have to change its thinking: real trust, when emotions are running high, is based on analogy, not calculation.&quot;Ratey is right to recognize the importance of emotions in our lives and in society, but hundreds of years of scientific research have shown us the utility of logical reasoning. Metaphor and analogy are useful, but they need to be used as a complement to logical reasoning, controlled studies and peer-reviewed research, not in their place.Despite the book's obvious flaws, the last chapter, &quot;Care and Feeding&quot; provides advice on nurturing one's brain that is probably valuable. The concepts are not complex: stay active mentally and physically, maintain a healthy diet, and provide new challenges and stimulus for your brain throughout your life."

I came out with more knowledge out of this book than I could have ever expected. The author covers so many different topics and is able to simply explain all of them so well that I had trouble putting the book down.The book was a great read from start to finish and does a good job of keeping the reader interested using little facts and tidbits that make the reader want to turn the page to find out more. From these tidbits, the author usually progresses to real life examples to better make his point. This helped for me to be consumed by the book as I read it and wanted to read more to keep learning more.The book has 10 chapters: Development, Perception, Attention and Consciousness, Movement, Memory, Emotion, Language, The Social Brain, The Four Theaters, and Care and Feeding. Each chapter has its own descriptions, analogies and case subjects. The author does of good job of progressing through the brain from the beginning of the book, but if the reader chooses to skip any section, they will not miss any important concepts that will impair the reading of the rest of the book.The author organizes the book into several different functions associated with the brain and goes through and talks about the main concepts related to those functions. The author gives many examples of problems associated with these neural concepts and how they are based in the brain's biology. Although there is some biological descriptions throughout the book out of necessity, the book is geared towards the average reader. The author explains from the introduction that the language and terminology associated with neuroscience can only be understood by a certain few individuals, and because of this, he tries to ""dumb down"" the language in the book in order to allow the average reader to understand all of the new and exciting findings in the field of neuroscience.One of the most interesting chapters of the book was the first chapter: Development. From the start, I was shocked to learn how plastic the brain can truly be. Learning about how an autistic woman was able to teach herself how to be more socially ""normal"" was an incredible story in how knowledge and hard work can help overcome even the most challenging of tasks. The author goes on and describes the challenges encountered throughout the developmental process of the brain and how many of these disrupt the brain and help in the creation of neural disorders.The chapter about perception was an incredible eye opener into how our brain can dictate our lives, even if all of our other organs work perfectly. ""Every Psychology 101 course begins with a chapter on perception, which usually mystifies freshmen. `Why study how information enters the mind,' they wonder, `when we are really interested in what happens to it afterward?' The young, introspective, answer-seeking students in search of self-discovery get pretty turned off by lectures about pigeons' and rats' vision and hearing. Instructors even apologize for having to teach perception in the first place, and ask students to be patient while they rush through it so they can get to `the good stuff' of psychology, like Freud and sex, drugs, ad rock-`n'-roll."" Page54 The example of how a girl's life fell apart and was diagnosed as schizophrenic only because her vision was distorted was an amazing story of how something as simple as a slight distortion in vision can completely change a person's life.In Attention and Consciousness, the author takes a little more in depth view into the brain and how many different structures work together to help you stay alert throughout the days. He explains how and why the mind is able to filter different stimuli depending on what you are paying attention to in order to focus on certain things rather than having to digest the entire world around you at one moment. ""Reaction to stimuli, ongoing talk between neurons, and predictive maps of the world all work together to create consciousness. Before we can be conscious of something, however, we have to pay attention to it."" (114) Movement goes on to describe how intricately intertwined movement is to all the other brain functions and how it isn't a ""lower"" brain function at all. Movement itself is entwined with certain brain disorders that are caused not by normal mental dysfunction but by problems with movement circuits in the brain.From there the author moves on to Memory and Emotion chapters. In Memory, he describes how memories can be very subjective depending on how the person experiences them, and that when two people share different sides of the story, it isn't that one is right or wrong, it is that both experienced the event differently. He goes on to explain how the storage of memories is affected and how memories can actually be ""falsified"" if the person can truly imagine themselves having done the action. In Emotion, it is described how a person's state of being and emotion can completely consume their entire lives. Those with highly active emotions can react abnormally and extremely to normal stimuli that most would not even notice.In the Language chapter, it is described how the acquisition of language can affect the overall development of the brain and how we learn things. The debate over whether language is ""born or bred"" into our brains at is addressed and how there is no accepted answer to how language came about. Language leads to the development of The Social Brain, where brain injuries that lead to decreased social skills are addressed. It is examined how certain cases had brain injuries where normal body function was retained, but due to damages to social function, the subject was unable to function normally in society and normally ended up jobless and alone. The author talks about the different sections of the brain and how the development of each leads to success for humans as social creatures.The book ends with two chapters that first represent ""thoughts developed over many years and contributed"" by two of the author's associates and finishes with a chapter of tips and tricks of how to keep your brain active and healthy and explains his ""use it or lose it"" philosophy behind the brain.I recommend this book for readers looking for an interesting view into the human brain and the many wonders associated with it. The book does a good job of covering a broad range of topics and explaining them well and in simple enough language for those not learned in neuroscience to understand. For those looking for an in depth biological explanation behind the disorders, this is not the book for you. All in all, I recommend this book as a good read to those interested in neuroscience."

It doesn't go into details about how to cope with these kind of issues, but gives a great understanding of the ""how"" it was possible for these issues to be derived in the first place. It is not a book for disorders nor does it give advice. It simply helps you understand how the brain works from infancy onward.

Once completed, I installed ISA and referred back to the book for additional guidance. I'm still looking for the additional guidance.This title does a great job of introducing ISA to the reader. It spends chapters of time covering the ISA concept, architecture and Microsoft Minimum Requirements. From there, however, the book gets a little more glossy and sales brochure like. Deployment scenarios, installation and (very) basic configuration are covered, but the author has chosen to really only cover the installation of ISA in an enterprise / array configuration, leaving the stand-alone server installation out in the cold. Past the installation, the author tour guides you through the basic setup of the server (which actually was very handy and without this it would have taken me quite a while to figure it out) and then moves on to briefly cover some of the major selling points.What is really missing from this book is any specifics, or even an in-depth, point by point reference covering of the interface and components. For example, the author covers setting alerts for Intrusion Detection, but instead of explaining the configuration choices for each of the five actions, the author tells you that ""Depending on your selection, a different window will appear that enables you to configure the option you selected.""The title is helpful, and I am glad I read it.

Reads like a Microsoft reviewer's guide.,"It's not so much that this is a bad or poorly written book (it isn't!), but it is seriously flawed:- The vast majority of the book is about installing and configuring ISA, with relatively little coverage of ongoing using or troubleshooting.- There is a lot of very basic stuff, as well as a lot of stuff that you'd normally find in a Microsoft reviewer's guide for ISA. For example, an entire chapter on how ISA fits into IP (and an intro to TCP/IP), an entire chapter on system requirements.- Too much FLUFF! In addition to the 9 blank, lined pages of &quot;NOTES&quot;, the 25 pages listing (doublespaced) TCP known-ports, and the extra large font that pumps the index up to 24 pages, there are too many step-by-step, illustrated, descriptions of how to do basic tasks. Subtract the fluffiness noted above along with a few other egregious instances, and you're looking at a 250 or 300 page book, not a 408 page book.The only reason I read this book was because I was paid to do so. I don't use Microsoft software anymore, but I've used (and reviewed for publication) enough of it for a lifetime. Which is another reason not to buy this book--but an entirely different issue altogether.If you must use ISA, or if you must consider using ISA, this book will actually be worth it--it comes with a 120-day trial version of the software (another odious practice, but that yet another issue as well)."

But I have yet to try a recipe from the book that didn't need at least minor tweaking to work, and one of the recipes ended up causing a huge (and expensive) problem.Some of the problems are minor: The basic pasta dough needs about two tablespoons of water to come together properly, and the spinach pasta will need more. Some aren't so minor: I have no idea what on earth the pretzel recipe is supposed to produce (paving bricks, maybe?), but the dry, stiff, crumbly dough was impossible to work with even after I added a lot of water and kneaded it vigorously with the dough hook and with my hands. I went over the ingredients several times to make sure I didn't miss something, so I'm inclined to wonder if the recipe as it's written in the book is missing an ingredient or a step.And then there are the downright disastrous problems: The tagliatelle (pasta) recipe produces too much dough for a 5-quart Artisan KitchenAid to handle. The dough clogged the workbowl, jammed the dough hook, and burned out my KA's motor in just a few seconds.Maybe there are some decent recipes in the book (I'm too afraid to try another one and risk my poor mixer again), but I'd advise fellow KitchenAid addicts to look elsewhere."

The crime to be solved is made to seem convoluted but ultimately turns out to be relatively simple. But as with each book in this series it isn't really about the plot. It's about Easy's singular way of seeing and evaluating and dealing with the people he encounters along the way, his perspective on a period of time that seems both long ago and immediate. His character is further fleshed out with each novel, and going along for the ride with him on the particular case he's working on is always a pleasure. If you enjoy the writing of Raymond Chandler you'll probably enjoy that of Walter Mosley and vice versa, only with Mosley you get an added dose of social commentary, not to mention Easy's psychotically entertaining buddy, Mouse."

It is presented from the viewpoint of a black investigator, Easy Rawlins. The setting is the Los Angeles area in the early 1960s. Civil rights are just getting into motion.Easy is a wannabe real estate mogul who is short on cash. He needs to support himself and two children that he has taken in (unofficially adopted). He needs money, and has been approached to find Black Betty - the nickname of a woman whom he knew in Texas when he was a child. He has a reputation for being able to find people.It is a complex case. There are questions about just why people are looking for Black Betty. A number of people are killed along the way, and relationships are established as the story moves along. There are some very ugly people, including racist police officers. This was well before the time of Rodney King when events could be picked up on video.Things do not necessarily end well. You will get a good view of some of the underside of society and people's social attitudes. There are some side plots.

Mosley tend to talk too much about how hard it is to be a black man in 1950's LA but you never really feel the anguish. Easy's situations are too far fetched. It's simply not believable. These feeling may have come out because I've read a few too many Easy Rawlin's novels and frankly its hard to differentiate between them. Standard formula: woman in trouble in black part of town because she has messed around with someone outside of her race. Easy gets in trouble because he's black. Boring....I did enjoy the passages about his kids. It's a mystery novel and I am not a fan of the genre which could account for my lackluster appraisal.

The title character has no real role in the book. We look for this lady for 200+ pages, but when we find her, there's nothing there. The setting, characters, and dialog are excellent. But the book spins out of control. The last 75 pages wind the plot so over-complex, I began losing track of who was who and what linked to what. I suspected a kind of &quot;set-up,&quot; also as I approached the conclusion. Betty, the title character, had been kept as a kind of slave for many years-- a sex slave, really. The oppressor was a wealthy white man, respected by the community. The author injected numerous comments to the effect, 'that's the way it always is, a black person enslaved by whitey.&quot; Was I reading an allegory, or watching the author spin out his own social resentments? I had mixed reactions. I've seen the film version of &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress.&quot; It was excellent. I am not sure &quot;Black Betty&quot; would make a good film without major editing."

The inhabitants of this world have strange names like Mofass, Mouse, LaMarque, Odell and Juice. It's the unsettled era of Kennedy, Khrushchev and Martin Luther King. And it's L.A., where black people thought twice before stepping into white neighborhoods.Easy is handling several problems at once in this novel. Someone hires him to find a woman known as Black Betty, and pain and death seem to follow him everywhere on his search. Meanwhile his best friend Mouse, in jail for murder, just got out and wants to kill the man who turned him in. And Easy's got financial troubles too, involving some property that's slipping through his fingers.The search for the missing Betty is particularly disturbing. When Easy was a boy, he was obsessed with Betty, who ""had something about her that drove men wild."" She was generous with her charms, but when a man's pockets were empty, she was gone. When Easy was twelve years old she kissed him for fun, and after that he followed her everywhere, her faithful errand boy and admirer.By now he's lost track of Betty for years, but he likes the idea of finding her again, for his own sake, not just for the fee. At the same time he's conflicted, not wanting to bring any harm to Betty. The people looking for Black Betty won't tell why they want her.This is my second Easy Rawlins book, and I find myself reading it less for the story than for the atmosphere simmering with danger, the poetic cadence of the language of the streets - and Easy's complex humanity."

Ezekiel Rawlins was home minding his own business when a seedy looking PI showed up to offer him a job. An old friend from Texas went missing and her employers - a wealthy family from Beverly Hills - want to find her. It sounds simple enough, but nothing is ever simple in Rawlins' world, and he eventually finds Betty at the end of a corpse strewn trail all while trying to keep his psychotic friend Mouse from killing an innocent person. Mouse just got out of jail and wants to know who reported him to the police. Hotheaded and impatient, Mouse is determined that someone is going to die and doesn't much care who he kills.Along the way Easy is arrested, beaten, stabbed threatened and cheated in a real estate deal. Still he manages to solve the mystery of Betty's disappearance and stay alive.Mosley really excels in his character development even down to the way he describes their clothes. When he talks about Commander Styles, he mentions how his slacks may have been police-issued, but his shirt was fine-spun. He does the same when describing Gwen the housekeeper and notes that while she's wearing a uniform, it's an expensive fabric.

Easy juggles several situations at once and manages to bring order and justice to his world by the end of the book. I think the most endearing quality of Easy's is the love and care he gives to his kids, Jesus and Feather. The time spent with his family gives a good balance to the darker side of his life on the streets. There are some big surprises in this story...some good and some sad and good at the same time.

He creates a historical landscape peopled with vibrant and authentic characters who like most of us are flawed and lacking in some way. ""Black Betty"" is Mosley at his best. The mystery is enthralling and many layered, the atmosphere electric, and the villains exquisitely evil.The time is 1961 the era of Martin Luther King, John Kennedy, and the beginning of The Civil rights movement. Easy Rawlings is raising two adopted children on his own, and his secret real-estate empire is sinking. He has no idea how to solve his financial problems until a sleazy private eye Saul Lynx approaches him with a job. Lynx offers Easy $200 to track down a former acquaintance of his, Elizabeth Eady, aka Black Betty. Betty a beautiful and sensual woman has vanished from her wealthy employer's home in Beverly Hills.Easy's search for Betty will uncover a trail of chaos and murder. To make matters worse, Easy's psychopathic best friend Mouse is also out of prison determined to find and execute the man who betrayed him. However, this book is much more than a murder mystery; it is a journey into the heart of racial bigotry and the paradox that is the human race. The language is vibrant and moving:On the bus there were mainly old people and young mothers and teenagers coming in late to school. Most of them were black people. Dark-skinned with generous features. Women with eyes so deep that most men can never know them. Women like Betty who'd lost too much to be silly or kind. And there were the children, like Spider and Terry T once were, with futures so bleak it could make you cry just to hear them laugh. Because behind the music of their laughing you knew there was the rattle of chains. Chains we wore for no crime; chains we wore for so long that they melded with our bones. We all carry them but nobody can see it-not even most of us. All the way home I thought about freedom coming for us at last. But what about all those centuries in chains? Where do they go when you get free?This is not merely a fast paced and gripping mystery but a powerful story of one of the saddest aspects of American life. Mosley does not preach nor condemn, he merely presents us with a historically accurate account of an era in which this mystery story unfolds. I highly recommend this story."

It would be nice of there was a cd of a complete episode of ""radio free dixie,"" but what we have here is a good introduction for the uninitiated.RFW's speeches may be too hot to handle for most listeners today (especially what he says about ""the torch""), but it must be approached with an open mind. Like Nelson Mandela's ""Spear of the Nation"" in S/A in prior to his imprisonment, RFW made it clear that he was not speaking about initiating foolhardy and random acts of violence, but strictly within the bounds of self-defense. He did not engage in the gasbag rhetoric of charlatans that passes for black nationalism today that is designed for television cameras and brings cheers to bitter people. RFW was literally fighting for his life in many cases against the Klan and other racist groups and his actions backed up his words.But enough of that-get this cd and read the above mentioned books and find out what your history teacher didn't tell you in high school.

The author was overall Israeli commander of this battle and his style of writing gives the reader a you-are-there feeling as the battle is planned and fought. If you like alot of action, you will enjoy this book. There is not a dull page. What I really appreciate about this narrative is the way it brings out the reality of combat. Seldom does anything go as planned. Mistakes are made and confusion is usually present. Among the bullets and bombs almost every human emotion is presented. War is terrible, but there is a time for glory.Basically, the battle is in stages. Various strategic points must be taken by the Israelis from the Jordanians in a precise order. The reader is taken from one point to the next and is introduced to the major Israeli combat units and leaders in the process. A nice map of Jerusalem at the time of the battle is at the front of the book, so the reader can easily follow the flow of action."

Areas so long occupied by Jordan.Monumental events that have since held intense, international, political and religious significance. Even today Jerusalem is central to the Middle East 'peace process' and the stumbling block to virtually all negotations. The momentous events described here eventually resulting in Jerusalem going on to be officially declared as the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel during August 1980. A fact yet to be recognised by most of the international community.Israeli Lt. General Mordechai Gur, the first to break through and reach the Temple Mount provides an excellent, firsthand account of the events leading up to, during, and following the 1967 battle for Jerusalem and the actual taking of the Temple Mount during the conflict.This is a highly personal, intense account of the actual fighting. You feel as if you are there with the troops on the ground. Those familiar with the streets and environs of Jerusalem &amp; the Old City will be even more so.The progress of the actual battle against the well-armed and well-trained Jordanian forces is documented throughout and the momentous sentiment expressed towards the end when suddenly at the Western Wall is almost palpable.An exceedingly well written, moving account which proceeds at a rapid pace hardly pausing for breath from once incident to another.

I could not believe that a book about so important an occasion in military history could be found in the bargain area. As I found out after I started to read, there was a reason why the book was in the bargain area. My main problem with book was with the way it is written. The book is written as if it were a diary or journal. There is very little background information given. No backstory. No explaination as to people and places. Figures come and go without regard. It is just poorly written. The guy who wrote it was a general who participated in the battle for Jerusalem, but he is no writer. My secondary issue has to do with lack of pictures, diagrams, photos, etc.. The only picture is that of a crudley drawn map of the city of Jerusalem. Hate to be a bummer. Love the history - hate the book. Glad I got it for a pittance, because I left it at the airport for someone else to judge. I understand that the book was originally written in hebrew, and then translatted. Maybe something was lost in translation. Not everyone is a writter."

Like the speech that labels a southern with the dropped 'g' so does Southern writing take on a tone that is distinctive and different. Despite my background in literature, however, until now I've neglected Texan writing, with its infinite differences that strike at the common elements of the human spirit. Indeed, I've now learned that Southern writing, Texas style, is a genre all its own. With the fluid grace of a hot summer day and iced tea, TEXAS BOUND: BOOK III reveals the people and the land make Texas writing its own sub-genre.From cowboys to common experience, these authors capture disdain for social fripperies and Wal-Mart sex appeal. Ordinary experiences take on freshness with distinctive language that becomes trademark for Texas style, as does the capturing of flow of conversation, and the flavors of pepper and pickled okra. Ordinary struggles become extraordinary when facing pregnancy or death. Indeed, as William J. Cobb says as he captures the movement of time and tragedy, &quot;things get boring without trouble.&quot; And trouble comes extra large in Texas.TEXAS BOUND moves with the perfection and grace of masterful storytelling. The words on the page hold the rhythm and cadence of speech, lending each story a sense of immediacy and importance. The simplest elements of life take on richer meaning through the act of observance and recounting. While the stories move from passionate to poignant, from humorous to tragic, each will capture the heart and imagination. Very highly recommended."

The apologists for the Holocaust (revisionism is always apologetics) in academia are hideously indifferent to the greatest devastation and assault on humanity ever known. I had to laugh at the post-modern historian's lament about the 'fact fettish' of traditional historians. This book may be considered the starting point in the inquiry on why many students leave academia less able to think critically than when they enter. This is a tragedy, particularly because the 'new' history (or literature or psychology, etc.) is so boring and formula-driven that a daily newspaper is more informative, relevant, and interesting in comparison. This book is an eye-opener for those who wonder why so many college graduates are clueless about where they are in human history and how they got here.

Regardless of your current opinions, this book is going to make you think. If you are not afraid to check your values and judgements, read the book.P.xi ""Historians who think it the highest calling of their profession to resurrect the 'daily life of ordinary people' can find little evidence in the daily life of ordinary Germans of the overwhelming fact of life-and of death-for millions of Jews; those who look for the 'long-term' processes and impersonal 'structures' in history tend to explain this 'short-term event' in such a way as to explain it away; and those seeking to 'deconstruct' the history of the Holocaust as they deconstruct all of history come perilously close to the 'revisionists' who deny the reality of the Holocaust. And so with philosophers and literary critics for whom there is no reality but only language, no philosophy but only a play of mind, no morality but only rhetoric and aesthetics.""P.6 ""The beasts of modernism have mutated into the beasts of postmodernism-relativism into nihilism, amorality into immorality, irrationality into insanity, sexual deviancy into polymorphous perversity. And since then, generations of intelligent students under the guidance of their enlightened professors have looked into the abyss, have contemplated those beasts, and have said, 'How interesting how exciting.' Today, students in some of the most distinguished departments of literature are all too often reading books about how to read books. Literary theory has replaced literature itself as the fashionable subject of study. Structuralism and deconstruction, gender theory and the new historicism, reader-response and speech-act theory-these are more hotly debated than the content and style of particular novels or poems.""P.17 ""This is the intention behind some of the most fashionable schools of history: that which explains everything in terms of race, class, and gender; that which focuses entirely upon the daily lives of ordinary people; that which structuralizes history, displacing individuals, events, and ideas by impersonal structures, forces, and institutions. The effect in each case is to mute the drama of history, to void it of moral content, to mitigate evil and belittle greatness. Looking into the most fearsome abysses of modern times, these historians see not beasts but faceless bureaucrats, not corpses but statistics.""There is a whole chapter on Marx and his writings. Also a chapter on the significance in the long story of history of nationalism and post modernism."
B000IMSHZK,On Looking Into the Abyss: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society,,A1RJD10TTI568L,"Pieter Uys ""Toypom""",5/6,5.0,1265414400,Exposing our era's intellectual fraud and spiritual impoverishment,"With impressive scholarship, keen insight and courteous polemics, Himmelfarb challenges the intellectual deception and spiritual poverty of our era. Most of the essays examine the trash that's become intellectually fashionable since the1980s. The title essay braves the swamps of postmodernism inhabited by the demons of nihilism, irrationality and immorality. She dissects deconstruction and related pseudo-philosophies particularly for their baleful effect upon philosophy, literary criticism and historical studies. In the madhouse of deconstruction, the interpreter takes precedence over the text that is interpreted, with comical or insane results. The objective is to undermine reality by denying that it exists.She warns of the consequences when we are informed that philosophy has nothing to do with wisdom or virtue, that metaphysics is really linguistics, that morality is a form of aesthetics and that the best approach is not to take philosophy seriously. And about what happens to our sense of the past when we are told there is no past except that which the historian creates, or to our perception of the significance of history when we are assured that it is we who give it meaning, or to that terrifying historical event, the Holocaust, when it can be so easily 'demystified' and 'deconstructed'?Hegel deified Reason, arguing that every individual could rely on their own reason, accepting as true what seems rational according to individual judgment. Thus a train of thought was set in motion that led to Feuerbach representing religion as the failure of humanity's critical reason and Max Stirner claiming the Ego as the only reality. The destination becomes obvious. Himmelfarb shows up many contradictions in Marx: his habit of portraying his proletarian protagonist in pejorative ways, his counterfactual assertion that the needy would forever become poorer and thesinister sacrificial visionlurking behind his materialist interpretation of history. The author's epitaph for Marx has proved to be far too optimistic: the collectivist serpent returns from Hades again and again.The essay on Liberty confronts the icon of modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill. She convincingly argues that his doctrine of the absolute freedom of the individual inevitably leads to relativism. And if truth can be relativized, morality will follow. She laments our materialist culture that bans unhealthy foods but not sadistic movies and forbids racial segregation but not moral degradation. Absolute liberty tends to subvert the very freedom it seeks to maintain as it grants itself the right to assault the foundations. This was also clearly pointed out by Polanyi in his seminal work Science, Faith and Society.The Dark and Bloody Crossroads Where Nationalism and Religion Meet includes a comparison between the newer versus the established nation states. As the newer ones become more assertive and brutal, the older nations are becomingspineless and passive, ashamed of affirming the legitimacy of their own benevolent expression of nationalism and afraid of challenging the legitimacy of the oppressive tribal mode. The same can be said for Western standards of decency and what's left of our religion. In this regard, The Return of History and the End of Dreams by Robert Kagan is most relevant.Himmelfarb believes that the historian should be able to identify heroes and villains in history and judge their behavior. The denial of good and evil trivializes theShoah/Holocaust and the Gulag. It is incumbent upon us to maintain the reality of the past. She maintains that professionalism in history respects the reader and our ancestors whilst upholding the credibility of the discipline. The practice of professionalism confirms the humility of the serious historian that rejects both the arrogant claim to exactly recapture the past and the ludicrous notion of the past's unreality.Historians educated in the old school of footnoting is struck by the increasing number of academic publications that have no notes at all and even boasts about their lack of sources. The skeptic Voltaire called historical details ""the pests that destroy books."" His heirs the postmodernists have taken this disdain for research to extremes by denying truth itself. The fatuousness with which postmodernists proclaim the failure of beauty, truth and value contrasts sharply with the reverence of the modernists who defined it. Chantal Delsol sets out an interesting diagnosis of this affliction in her books Icarus Fallen andThe Unlearned Lessons Of the Twentieth Century.Himmelfarb explains how postmodernist historians long to be considered creative and imaginative but by rejecting the causal and chronological narrative, they turn history into fiction. Like all honest historians,the modernistswere aware that total objectivity is impossible but they still pursued it through the critical evaluation of evidence. They placed a premium on research and primary sources, the authenticity of documents, reliability of witnesses, the need to obtain substantiating and countervailing evidence, the accuracy of quotations and citations and prescribed forms of documentation in footnotes and bibliography.Postmodernistphilosophy holds truth in such contempt that one doubts the jokers themselves believe their assertions. Just like literary critics play with texts by twisting them in a myriad ways, so postmodern historians tell tales aimed at empowering whatever victim group is the flavor of the moment. Himmelfarb's abyss refers to the chasm of meaninglessness and despite her courtesy, at times a tone of exasperation and more rarely of revulsion surfaces in her writing. She takes on both the originators like Nietzsche, Mill, De Mann and Heidegger and their disciples such as inter alia Derrida, Foucault and Rorty.I also recommendThe Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politicsby Mark Lilla, Last Exit to Utopia by Jean-Franois Revel, Explaining Postmodernism by Stephen Hicks,Why Truth Mattersby Ophelia Benson & Jeremy Stangroom, Experiments Against Reality by Roger Kimball and the same author'sTenured Radicalsin the 3rd edition of which he demonstrates how the trends he observed in the early 1990s had taken over the humanities and started to seep into popular culture within the space of a decade."

B000N6QK50,I Take Thee Serenity,,A2KBJ3NHMCWZIW,"""celtinore""",12/13,5.0,977097600,A great book about knowing and being yourself.,"I first read this book almost 20 years ago, when I was a young person trying to figure out who the real &quot;me&quot; was and how she fit into the world. Even now, with children of my own, I find this book very readable. Serenity Ross is nineteen years old, a college student majoring in elementary ed (but longing to major in art history) who is engaged to be married to Peter Holland, a fellow student who is seeking to better understand the world into which he will become a man. Serenity's parents, middle-aged middle-class suburbanites, hide their true feelings about their daughter's marriage by planning a real dog-and-pony show; but the bride herself feels a yearning for something more meaningful than a big church wedding and country-club reception. This yearning leads her on a weekend visit to Oliver Otis, her father's cousin, and his wife, Daphne, in rural Rhode Island. The visit is only the first step for Serenity on a journey -- of self-discovery, and an exploration of her family's spiritual roots --on which she is joined by Peter and, eventually, her parents as well. The Otises are members of the Society of Friends, better known as the Quakers, and it is their ability to look honestly at life and see the good in it that guides Serenity and Peter on their way. But don't think that these are two-dimensional characters, oozing with saccharine sweetness and dispensing glib advice; Daisy Newman, the author and herself a member of the Society of Friends, draws them with loving but unflinching honesty. Oliver is a bit of a neat freak who likes things to be just so, and Daphne -- left unable to speak by a stroke -- struggles with anger when her eyes and her expressions are not enough to convey her thoughts to those around her. Their relationship with their daughter, Heather, who is married and lives a life of urban sophistication in London, is a lesson in miscommunication, and reminds us that even those we look up to in life are capable of making mistakes and handling things badly. If you know young people who are trying to find and express their genuine selves in this crazy, fast, shallow world, this book is terrific. Heck, if you're no longer young but looking for a good read to remind you that the best things in life are free, you won't go wrong here. (Be aware, however, that one of the issues Serenity and Peter confront is pre-marital sex -- definitely PG rated, no details or graphic descriptions, but it does occur and the question of &quot;Should we, shouldn't we?&quot; is a key component of the theme of the book. Kids 12 and older should be able to handle it very well.)"

This story of a driven businesswoman who encounters Quakers while researching an advertising campaign impressed me. I had heard of Quakers but never really knew anything about them or their religion. This gentle way of life appealed to me and I made it a point to search out other titles by this author. I just recently happened across ""I Take Thee, Serenity"" in my bookcase and re-read it, to be touched anew.Written in 1975, the premise of this book would now be considered old-fashioned. Serenity Ross is an independent 19-year-old in love with Peter Holland and quite content to have a sexual relationship with him while away at college. Suspecting this, her parents decide that it is best to have the two young people get married. Feeling pushed into a wedding that is taking on circus-like proportions and inspired by the picture of a Quaker wedding hanging in her parents' home, Serenity flees to her father's old family home near Kendal, Rhode Island to step back and take stock. There, she meets her elderly Quaker cousin, Oliver Otis, and his wife, Daphne, who help her to look into herself and her relationship with Peter and realize that their marriage will effect not only them but all of the people who love them.This journey of self-discovery can't help but touch the reader. The Quaker way, as presented here, is one of tolerance and understanding and reading this book gave me a sense of joy."

Lost in America, written by the gifted Nuland, is an ode to his father, a work of self-therapy for himself, a gift to his readers, and an offering to anyone looking for resolution and understanding of a difficult family situation.Lost in America begins with the author admitting to coming under the grips of debilitating depression, and the writing of this book seems to have been his way of fighting out of that despair, of coming to terms with some of its causes, and of trying to explain all that went wrong with his father's life as a Jewish immigrant in America - and how those failures impacted Sherwin Nuland. The turning point comes with Nuland's discovery that his father suffered the mental and neurological effects of late-stage syphilis - and with his acceptance that happiness for him would be impossible.Heartbreaking and oh, so beautifully written. But also difficult (on an emotional level) to read; you may find yourself putting it aside for a few days before wanting to continue. But persevere and read to the end. You won't regret it."

That book gave me some understanding and comfort following my father's death. In this beautifully-written and heart-wrenching memoir, Dr. Nuland tries to come to terms with his own father's death and in doing so, manages to exorcise some demons.This is a very brave memoir in that the author spares no one, including himself. It is at once brutally honest (sometimes so much so, that I had to stop reading) and incisive. His prose style--unusual for a doctor--is lyrical and succinct. He tells his story from a uniquely Jewish perspective (naturally) and so I wondered if readers with other religious affiliations would respond in the same way. Perhaps it doesn't matter.

As a surgeon, I was not impressed with explication of the disease processes that commonly caused death and the organization of the material; but I distinctly remember giving Nuland high praise for ""his literary facility with the narrative in the case histories and the poignancy of his boyhood family life"".This same literary power is revisited in ""spades"" as he deftly threads the emotions of ethnicity, bizarre family dynamics, guilt, failures, despair, poverty, illnesses, hatred, rage, control and triumph into the fabric of a powerful narrative. The chronology conveniently saves the denouement of the malady that causes the Father's problems to almost the end.The author's triumph in being appointed Chief Surgical Resident brought redemption for the father's failures as well as a modicum of reconcilliation and (unexpressed) love to the father-son rapport.The author's wish that his father would die so that he would not cause him further embarassment perhaps emanated the ethical guilt to be expunged by re-visiting the father-son dynamics in the writing of this book. The moral honesty with which he wrote of this relationship had to have been very painful for the author, as it seemed palpable to me in the reading(a mark of good literature).This is definitely Nuland's best literary work."

On these grounds alone, one must admire Nuland's honest assessment of his own situation growing up. The embarrassment children of immigrants feel at their parent's attachment to their old lives and inability to adapt to the new. The desire of the new generation to loose their ancestry and become truly American, contrasting with the older generations loss at never truly fitting in. Nuland's account is touching and honest. One feels for all of his characters deeply and cannot help but cry as many of the aspirations they share also pull them apart.Nuland's work can be read on two levels. The first, as an account of a particular group of immigrants, with all of their pain and joy brought to the fore through wonderfully poignant writing. Second, one sees how the immigrant experience transcends any particular group, and that what ever their point of origin, all immigrants share common aspirations and fears when they arrive on these shores. On either level, this brief page-turner is well worth your time."

It explained everything, and in the tradition of the day, his father was never told the truth - not that anything could have been done. By the time he received treatment, his nervous system was already permanently damaged.Interwoven are colorful stories of his own growing-up years (my personal favorite: learning the F word from older boys in the neighborhood), and the tragedy of his mother's death from cancer when he was 11. The type was never specified in the book; I had come to a conclusion that it was cervical or uterine cancer, and a Google search revealed that it was colon cancer. Either way, the results were the same. His father never remarried, but lived a platonic existence with two older female relatives (I read it a while back so don't recall the exact nature of their relation).He kicks off the book with his own episode with mental illness and the resulting institutionalization which destroyed his first marriage. I first heard about that in a Book TV interview where I learned about this book as well.

While the greatest emphasis is on the author's relation to his father, his relationships with other family members that shared the same household, his mother, his Bubbe, his Aunt Rose, his older brother are also described.The book opens with Nuland's description of himself in total depression, and about to receive a lobotomy, when a young psychiatric student prevents this, and instead prescribes an alternate treatment. Nuland receives twenty shock treatments and they take him out of his depression.He then by implication relates the depression to the story of his difficult childhood, and relation with his father. His father Max who worked as a tailor , was completely alone in America aside from his wife's family. He was a difficult suffering hypersensitive easily humiliated, easily outraged parent. Nuland tells the story of life in a home where his Bubbe and aunt did not speak with his father, and in which his beloved mother was the center until she passed away. Nuland tells of the years in which he accompanied his father,supported him as he limped along, and was ashamed of him. He quotes at length his father's Yiddishized English, a language which appears somehow grotesque and awkward without redeeming humor.Nuland also tells in a most moving way of dramatic moments in the family's life. The day his father comes home broken and weeping, carrying with him a Jewish Forward account of how in his native city the entire population had been murdered, machine gunned to death by the Nazis.Another moving tragic day is the day of Nuland's mother's death.One beautiful moment is the one in which Nuland is told that he has been made Chief Surgical Resident at Yale Presbyterian. He races to his father's hospital bed and tells him the news. And he feels his father's sense of triumph and justification.The older immigrant generation, his father, his mother, his Bubbe, his aunt had lived for the 'hope' of what the younger generation might become in America. And Nuland's success as a doctor justifies the father's life to himself. The person who had always felt insulted, humiliated comes a short time before his death to feel that it all has been worthwhile.This is once again a tremendously moving story. What I missed and what I have questions about are the other aspects of Nuland's life which are not written about. For instance it must have taken him an incredible amount of work and dedication to arrive at where he arrived in his studies. Nothing is said of that."

Here is another book about a dysfunctional Jewish family, with all the guilt, death, hardship, illness, poverty, etc. you've come to expect from this type of account. However, it goes nowhere. It strikes me as the type of book that was very cathartic to write and incredibly important to the author to look within himself and dredge up - something he admits that he has avoided for his entire life until now. However, unless you are trying to address the same issues with your own dysfunctional upbringing, it is not an interesting story.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and even sent off quotes to a friend who is doing a cross-disciplinary dissertation. Although it deals with &quot;scientific&quot; issues, Toulmin actually does a great job showing us how we came to think in some of the very general ways that way we do.As an adjunct professor trained in the Humanities, I can only wish I had read this 10 years ago when it came out! For anybody who ever desired to understand why and how 'postmodernism' is a reaction to the 1950's, this book is must reading. His basic thesis is simple and elegant; though a philosopher like Descartes may postulate timeless truth, the fact of the matter is that those 'timeless' truths are rooted in a specific historical situation and its limited sociology of knowledge. (In this case, the Thirty Years War which ravaged Europe from 1618-1648.) Western philosophy and science has been traditionally associated with the Quest for Certainty that initiated with Descartes. However, Toulmin shows how that was not necessarily the only viable means to achieve certifiable knowledge/science. Descartes was a child of the early 17th Century and the radical uncertainty that ravaged all of Europe during the Thirty Years War. The pricetag of achieving some manner of certainty to overcome the social chaos of that time was that the European academic community turned its back on the more eclectic, inductive, and humane tradition of the Renaissance thinkers like Montagne and Erasmus. This, as Toulmin shows, was not only tragic, but very limiting to all of Western Philosophy/Science/Culture for about 300 years.In a moment of rare insight, Toulmin then shows how this developed and eventually had parallels in our own century with the dogmatism that grew out of the aftermath of the First World War in the 1930s and the advent of Logical Positivism, and then again, in the stultifying conservatism of the 1950s which reacted in similar fashion to the chaos resulting from the Second World War. In a word, Toulmin shows us just how far the the academic/social community will sacrifice truth and knowledge for certainty when social climates dictate it. Understanding this dynamic allows us to realize that times of crisis need not be resolved by a Quest for Certainty which operates on principles of timeless truths or single domain methods. As Toulmin constantly advises us, there are no timeless methods which do not have an oppressive underbelly.Having been trained in rhetoric, psychology, literature, and religion, I found his book most enlightening. It should be in the libraries of all scientists, therapists, professors, pastors, theologians, and anybody else who is interested in how to proceed in this age of pluralism and its cornocopia of postmodern 'methods'."

Toulmin takes the reader on an exhaustive tour of the modernist program, tracing the roots of modern thought way, way back to the 16th century...and before. He makes a compelling case, with some interesting side trips, that modern thought grew out of the religious wars of the early 1600s and the desire for non-sectarian certainty that those wars created. If that doesn't make sense, you should read this book. Fascinating history, and a broad sweep of science and philosophy make this book quite readable, though neither short nor easy. Still, it goes a long way toward explaining why the ground seemed to shift under our feet around 1960. It was an earthquake that was as inevitable as it was overdue.

And this is exactly the strategy used by Toulmin in trying to make sense of our postmodern present. By studying the trajectory of modernity from it's inception in the Renaissance to the mid-1979s, Toulmin has succeded in demonstrating the &quot;decline and fall&quot; of modernity's worldview.The most important chapter of the book, for me personally, was the final chapter which argues for the need to adopt what he calls &quot;skeptical rationality&quot; rather than the foundational rationality of modernity.All in all an important study of modernity which should be read by any one who is interested in the zeitgeist of the present."

The synopsis of the story is as another reveiwer has already described below: namely that the kick-off of modernity with Descartes' ""I think therefore I am"" was not something that popped out of the blue of his profound brain but a working hypothesis in search of a foundation of certainty---to be applied to theology promarily so as to end the sort of savagery that was devastating Europe in the name of religion during his lifetime (the 30 Years War).Toulmin contextualizes Newton's discovery and Hobbes' political philosophy (briefly but enough to make the connection) in the light of this quest for certainty that held so many of the best minds in Europe spellbound for all these years. With a pace that won't let up, Toulmin takes you on a tour of Europe's social and intellectual transformation: going from poverty and social schism and a sense of doom in 1610 to a confident, unquestionable, and unquestioned, established cosmopolitical paradigm of order that was foisted onto social and political (thus also art) agendas.So far so good but it sounds like something you've heard before doesn''t it? That's when this book takes off:Toulmin digs at the 'subtexts' of these common-knowledge events to show you some very interesting presuppositions (seemingly innocuous at first) inherent in these great scientific discoveries that could not but lead to the institutionalization of racism, sexism, and nationalisms that had such traumatic consequences in the 20th century, with continuing severe after-shocks today.Looking back, we might smugly click our tongues at the insanity that gripped post-Montaigne Europe, and wonder what the fuss was all about. But Toulmin makes his thesis pressingly relevant to us today by drawing parallels with events and situations that are still with us today.The author rounds out his argument by giving a brief but clear accounting of the major players (French and German) today who are redefining the concept of modernity from mutually opposite ends.Toumin's assessment of the legacy of modernity--however it may have got started--is one of of hope and optimism as he reminds the reader that in making the distinction between 'power' and 'force' (Hobbes) there is also this thing called ' moral influence' which, he hopes, will serve as the engine of renewal and humanization of 'modernity' in all its possibilities.Maybe this is not the best or the most comprehensive account of the origin of post-modernism and/or its tendencies, but the book does give you about a 120 degree panorama--through a powerful telescope. Isn't that enough in a book?"

Matthews ""Sean Matthews""",3/3,5.0,1266192000,Good in almost all parts,"Stephen Toulmin was, everyone is agreed, a vastly learned nice guy. And he was also a great admirer of the benchmark 'learned nice guy' in the western intellectual tradition, Montaigne. At its core Cosmopolis is really a (very convincing, for those who need it) argument that intellectual life, civilization, and everything else would be much more healthy if we could learn to be a little more like Michael, and that in the last three hundred years we have lost sight of this. For most of its not very great length Cosmopolis makes the argument very effectively, albeit in the manner of a _very, very_ senior intellectual: if you are currently getting down to writing up your thesis, you probably do not want to be doing this at home. The first three chapters on the cultural-social causes and responses to Descartes, Leibniz, Newton and the rest, are entirely convincing.Alas, the fourth chapter is a disaster: after the birds-eye survey of western culture where he has focussed entirely on cultural sociology, the quality control suddenly falls off a cliff. The last bit is little more than a exercise in po-mo wishful thinking about secular shifts in the Zeitgeist, that reads more like a Feuilleton think-piece than a serious contribution. And I cannot imagine an eye-rolling sentence like 'There are things about Einstein's general theory of relativity, for example, that are understood best if we learn that Einstein was a visual rather than a verbal thinker' in the first three chapters. GR is a model of the fundamental geometry of space time, it's validity and its meaning are entirely independent of the particular way that Einstein derived it, just like the validity of Newtonian mechanics is independent of the way that Newton developed it. Einstein's preferences are interesting to a historian of science, and the public reception of GRT is interesting to a cultural anthropologist (in precisely the way that Toulmin, who is also careful to make, if only implicitly, precisely this distinction, explores for Newton in the first three chapters), but they are irrrelevant to a someone trying to _understand_ it. I'm sure Toumin thought that the 'intentional fallacy' thesis was egregious late modern silliness, and he was right (though, really, who, outside of student dorms, cares) - that does not mean that his attempt to extend the antithesis all the way into theoretical physics isn't egregious postmodern silliness.The first three chapters are a must read for anyone interested in intellectual history. The rest: na ja."

B000N76FOK,Cosmopolis: the Hidden Agenda of Modernity,,A2YVB04NGJU69V,Dennis B. Mulcare,0/0,4.0,1356998400,Excellent Beginning/Weak Closure,"Having previously read, enjoyed, and admired three other books by Toulmin (on logic, reasoning & argumentation), I had looked forward to reading Cosmopolis (humanities). Not surprisingly, I found its first three chapters (two-thirds of the books) very readable, insightful, and plausible. I especially liked his approach of ""re-contextualization"" to analyze and re-evaluate the received views on the genesis, nature, and effects of Modernity. Moreover, his interpretations and conclusions were for me quite intuitively satisfying and readily convincing: solid Five-Star content.Toulmin's development and application of the notion of ""scaffolding"" was very effective in distinguishing Presuppositions and situatedness from the actual Construction and elements of Modernity. Moreover, the scaffolding metaphor was used to investigate the origins, formulation, and justification of these elements. Also, it was employed as a clever organizing theme over the first three-and-a-half chapters, ultimately being used in characterizing the historical incremental discrediting of the major supporting bases of Modernity.Evidently, the classical accounts of Modernity's formation have taken a narrow and idealized view, akin to the strictures of abstraction and universality exercised by the 17th century's seminal thinkers themselves. In consequence, these accounts diminished the influence of historical and societal contexts, and further, declined to examine the latent presuppositions. Toulmin accordingly re-contextualized the unfolding of Modernity's construction, and examined the implications and validity of the presuppositions: in all, the methodologically reasonable thing to do. Additionally, he described the ready acceptance and historical application of the derivative concept of Cosmopolis. It was based on a confluence of central ideas of Newton and Descartes in pursuit of order and certainty. To a Europe exhausted from religious conflict then, Cosmopolis offered a synergistic/harmonious worldview of nature and humanity, thereby capturing the desired attributes of stability and hierarchy. Toulmin next critiques Modernity's actual outcomes and consequences in its dominating legacy extending into the 20th century. In all, this is an enlightening and compelling, if revisionist, view of modernity.The transition in tone, coherence, and content beginning in the fourth chapter, however, really did surprise me! Beginning with the section entitled 1965-1975: Humanism Reinvented, the tone shifted from scholarly and thoughtful investigation/exposition to glib or unsupported assertions/construals/endorsements. Basically, it struck me that Toulmin was gratuitously articulating fashionable contemporary ""dogma"", i.e., using a coercive device that earlier in the book he had stigmatized as a undesirable practice of 17th century religious institutions. These ostensibly unwarranted add-ons to his previously scholarly critique made it difficult for me to complete reading the book: a Two-Star finale.Three instances of such problematic passages may be noted:On page 166, an Assertion is made regarding Christ's statement that ""The poor ye have always with you"". To wit: ""Now, many believers in `traditional values' understood Him to mean...that it is the business of the poor to stay poor, of blacks to stay deferent, of women to stay home, and of the handicapped to stay in the back room, and of homosexuals to stay in the closet"" (note the qualifier ""many""). This is an unbelievably preposterous contention, so I can only presume that this assertion is just part of contemporary academic folklore.On page 168, a Construal associates ""scientific understanding"" with the condom fetish in sex education, and ""ideology"" with the opposing view. The purported science invoked here is questionable at best in light of the empirical evidence bearing on the stated expectations of sex education proponents. Accordingly, the highly dubious scientific understanding applauded here seems itself to be ideologically driven, not empirically based. This example hardly qualifies as an instance of science worthy of the name.On page 185, an implicit Endorsement cites a proposed reorganization of MIT's discipline-oriented academic departments, wherein administrative units would fashion the academic programs in accord with their judgments with respect to ""addressing particular types of human needs"". This unattributed proposal is utterly bizarre and unworthy of any mention much less consideration. If the fatuous proposal was indeed serious, it is clearly the product of sheer unreasonableness or blithe ignorance.Unfortunately, passages like the three cited above contribute to an incongruous closure to an otherwise well developed account of Modernity. Worse, they significantly compromise the merit of the book. Sadly, Toulmin's evident rashness belies his apparent advocacy of tolerance and open-mindedness in this book. I nonetheless, highly recommend at least the first two-thirds of the book. The remaining one-third strikes me as the ""switch part"" of a ""bait-and-switch"" proposition, albeit not necessarily an intentional one. It might instead be that Toulmin just got lazy or simply struggled to make a target page count."

What I found was a book that I consider an embarrassment to Toulmin. It felt like reading Antony Flew's senile recantation of atheism. You get the feeling that the author simply is not all there.The book is almost literally a mile wide and an inch deep. It consists of sweeping but vague generalizations. There is a lot of name-dropping but not much in the way of supporting documentation, and nothing in the way of careful analysis of the position of any modern historian or philosopher. It has virtually nothing to say about recognized postmodernist authors or books.What it has in the way of history is just bad history. For example, in the first chapter Toulmin describes -- and then proceeds to knock down -- what he calls the ""standard account or received view"" of the birth of ""Modernity"" in the first half of the 17th century. But this ""standard account"" is a pure fabrication. It is not described using quotations from any recognized historian. It is -- quite literally, see page 13 -- Toulmin's version of what he remembers being taught during his schoolboy days in the 1930's and 1940's.So here is Toulmin, writing in the 1990's, knocking down an historical account that he remembers from 50 years earlier. The problem is that no one since the 1930s has ever held such a view. In fact, I doubt if any serious historian ever held such a view even in the 1930s. Quite the reverse, in fact: see for example Basil Willey's fine study ""The Seventeenth Century Background"" [1934]. In place of Toulmin's rather muddy notion of ""contextualizing knowledge"", read Willey's much more straight-forward discussion (in chapter 1) of what counts as an ""explanation"".In summary, I can't see that this book has anything to offer a discerning reader."

I did enjoy Black Arrow, but I found it to be the least enjoyable of these four medieval-themed novels. All three others exceeded Black Arrow in these respects:- Level and accuracy of historical detail. The other works really immerse you in the period and allow you to experience the history. In contrast, Black Arrow merely uses the history as the backdrop, and even plays loose with facts.- Compelling characters and captivating story. I just didn't find Black Arrow's characters or story quite as riveting as the others.Overall: I enjoyed this work and I'm glad I read it. If you're looking for a historical novel from the medieval period, there are better ones out there. If instead you're simply looking for a good adventure, you'll definitely enjoy this.

Most of the book is spent developing a systematic method of making sure a design will work reliably, even under the unfavorable conditions of a ""worst-case"" scenario. The book would probably be most useful to electrical engineers, electronics technicians, and serious hobbyist who are just getting started in embedded systems and need some good background material.

While the copyright is 2004, most of the book reads as if it was written in 1994 or even earlier. The book talks a lot about discrete logic, something that's rarely (or barely) used in modern embedded designs. Likewise, the author largely assumes external memory, which is also increasingly rare.Most people, today, use SPI, I2C and/or CAN serial interfaces within (and even between) embedded devices and peripherals. The book doesn't provide useful coverage of any of these (or even mention some of them). It's as if the author's last real world embedded development work was with the 8051 a few decades ago? It's the only processor he goes into any detail on and not even the current System on a Chip versions.The book does contain a useful primer to basic electronics and microcontroller theory. But like the rest of the book, much of it is out of date relatively to current embedded design and the same material is covered much better in other books.The only reason to POSSIBLY buy this book, in my opinion, is the chapter on worst case timing and loading analysis. But even that section is showing its age. Signal levels, PC board design, bus/signal termination, impedance matching techniques, etc. are largely done differently today than what the author suggests. For example, do you know anyone using TTL discrete logic in their current embedded designs? Apparently both Ken Arnold and Newnes/Elsivier think someone does? You can have my copy back Amazon."

If you want to understand why people believed in witchcraft,werewolves, the persecution of heretics, the trying of animals for crimes against humans etc, this book explains it all. It clearly shows that the beliefs of past times were no more irrational than our own, given the way people knew the world to be. If you read this book you can understand why, for instance,in 1545 it seemed reasonable to the townsfolk of Saint-Julien-de-Maurienne in France to sue a plague of flies for destroying a vinyard.More disconcertingly, the book also shows that our own modern beliefs are often no more rational than the beliefs of the past, and that for instance the same reasons that led people to accept the truth of confessions of witchcraft, led people in modern times to accept the reality of Satanic abuse. If you pride yourself on being more rational than folk in past times, your opinion may be shaken by this book. The book is written in a lucid, witty style that makes it pleasantly easy to read for the unscholarly (like me), and should be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in history and why people believe what they do."

From witches and werewolves to demons and walking corpses, this is an illuminating romp into the medieval worldview.So what exactly is Oldridge's point in writing this book? Simply this: The people of the medieval and Renaissance worlds were not ignorant, superstitious, irrational, bestial, or stupid. They had the same brains and intelligence that we have. Their actions and beliefs, far from being irrational, were perfectly sensible given their worldview. Furthermore, we are no better: The modern West has plenty of irrational beliefs and habits of our own!Thought-provoking, honest, and exceedingly readable, Oldridge has produced a work which educates, entertains, and gently rattles about our assumptions of our own superiority.

In pre-modern times, educated people thought very seriously about such things that today most of us would consider absurd, e.g.., werewolves, witches, walking dead, etc. Also, in those olden times, people thought rather differently about God, angels, saints, demons, demonic possessions and the devil than most of us do today. Intelligent, educated thinkers of pre-modern times had a way of looking at things that may seem strange to us yet were perfectly in line with their times. The logical arguments that they used to address their contemporary problems had common sense structure - only their starting assumptions were vastly different from those we would use today. One can only guess at what humans living, say, a thousand years from now will think about our own ways of viewing the world. Through discussing specific cases and quoting contemporary writers, the author of this excellent book does a commendable job of illustrating the above.

It's a history of human intellectual behaviour and a study of the different ways we look at our surroundings, from the late 15th century until the 1700's.In 1438 a pig was hanged for murder in Burgundy. The French judge Henri Boguet described an apple possessed by demons in 1602. A few years later, Italian Jesuits tried to calculate the physical dimensions of hell.These and many other ideas from the late Middle Ages and the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries seem absurd today, but they made good sense to people at the time. This book explains how beliefs that are strange to us were once widely accepted. It sets out the intellectual world of men and women in the distant past, and shows how their assumptions and expectations allowed them to believe things that we cannot: that heresy and witchcraft posed a threat to society, that demons carried people through the air and that the dead occasionally walked away from their graves.None of these ideas were mad. They simply reflected the belief system of the medieval and Renaissance world. In fact an understanding of the rational basis of beliefs that now seem absurd suggests that modern ideas may one day seem equally ridiculous.The reason why I like this book so much is because it compels you to study your own way of thinking but you won't be able to do that without a sense of humor"

Understanding the ""why"" of history is very important, since the alternative is to say that the pre-modern population lacked intelligent, rational persons at the highest levels of society. This, of course, is easily disproven and it is this recurring train of though that is the subtext of this book.The focus, of this book, as indicated by the title, is the stories, which include animal trials, witch hunts, werewolves, revanants, angels, demons, heretics, possesions, sabbats, vampires, and much more. Most of this was a little more ""church-centric"" than I expected, based solely on the title, but after I finished the book, I understood why. Basically, most European medieval episodes used the Bible as the basis for both law and science, and therefore all scholarly & legal writings had this as a subtext. The resulting discussions by subject resulted in a condensate of thew views of the protestant/catholic churches over history and by various scholars. It turned out to be fascinating.I personally found the trial concerning fruit flies stranger than the one concerning the pig, but overall, the strangeness of the stories did not disappoint. Suprisingly, what did disappoint me was subject of some of the ""modern correlations"" which I felt did not belong in the book. While the author of the book found killing a pig found guilty of killing a child to be strange, today's society has animal control officers willing to dispose on site of any dangerous animal. While the trial, of course, would not be done, animal control officers must first ascertain the guilt of the animal in question, rather than just killing an animal without evidence. The author ascerted time and again how we would find killing an animal for harming someone inhumane, and that the death of the people involved was simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, this is certainly not a universal. Many animals have ""rogue"" behaviors, as even television series point out, and I think this weakened his point.Another weak point was the view on heroin. He pointed out that in the past that people did not consider it's use life threatening, and that the modern view was that it is. The empircal facts dictate that heroin can cause the heart and respiration to diminish to the point that a patient will die with overdosage. That seems empirical enough for me to say that this isn't societal ""self evident"" statement, but an actual fact. The reason for the difference in views is the fact that we have things called toxicological screenings which were non-existant a couple of centuries ago.Overall, I laud the book, and the case to thoroughly examine anything we consider to be ""self evident.""Recommended."

It offers a wide range of opportunities to explore the highways and byways of Medieval & Renaissance worldviews. Oldridge offers a unique insight into the how & why our ancestors viewed such transgressions to the social contract of the time, and the complete normalcy of those views. What I found off putting was the rather superficial coverage that is offered to the topics the author selects. I have found other books that explore similar topics with more depth and penache. A welcome addition for the beginning student of historical oddities library. The style of this book is scholarly in a Master's thesis sort of way with an odd forced sense of humor that is unwelcomed. It lacks the immediacy needed to communicate why we did & do the things we do as human beings. In the final analysis- we are still creatures of absurd superstitions & prejudices.

And then he out-fought his master during the entire conflict, and it is all backed up by detailed research. Amazing.Then to become an independent hunter in the lower Mississippi delta where he made a small fortune every year, ultimately becoming a hunter of legendary status, a cowboy and a lawman as well. And those white men he killed in duels--and not to be prosecuted in Mississippi of all places.Then, when he was getting pretty long in the tooth, to be selected to take Roosevelt on two hunts, arguably the most famous hunts ever on American soil, it seems like it must be fiction, but it is not.And for this man to be the sole person responsible for the event that gave us the teddy bear. Why has his story not been told before?Anyway, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in southern history, hunting, Theodore Roosevelt, black history, teddy bears, and the civil war."

Threat or Menace??,"This is, maybe, an entertaining book--in the same way ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is considered by some people to be an entertaining movie. In this slim volume (160 pages) the authors have assembled a grab bag of mysteries, anomalies, and unanswered questions, and then had at it with a big ""MAYAN"" rubberstamp.The authors take Central America/classic Mayan territory only as their starting springboard. The pyramids of Egypt? The Mayans were there! The Piri Reis map? Obviously Mayan! Disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle? Must be a Mayan force field! The Nazca lines in Peru? A Mayan airport! (About which the Umlands remark ""Why would the Mayans build their airfields so far from their large urban centers? Those who ask these questions apparently have not driven from our modern airports into the nearest city!"" Hmm--but just offhand, I can't think of any modern airport situated over 2,000 miles from the city it serves...) Atlantis, Mu, Lemuria, Antarctica? Mayan colonies!Ranging into the very distant past, the authors declare that our Solar System's asteroid belt was formed when ""Planet X"" exploded as a result of Mayan mining engineers' attempts to extract the core metals. They conclude this because ... well, just BECAUSE! It's OBVIOUS, all right? They go on to recount that the Mayans then turned to Earth, but their mining operations were once again frustrated--by Pangaea's split into Laurasia and Gondwanaland. Either those Mayan miners were phenomenally slow workers, or the authors haven't really grasped the concept of continental drift... And we are warned that the Mayans have been awaiting a rescue mission from their homeworld for, oh, several hundred thousand years, so it could arrive here AT ANY MOMENT...It's funny: taken in broadest outline, a number of this book's themes and assertions--a high-technology precursor civilization unacknowledged by orthodox scientists and historians; a planet of the Solar System reduced to rubble by that civilization's activities; anomalous features on the moon--have been the focus of more recent, and fascinating, books by Joseph Farrell (COSMIC WAR), Richard Hoagland (DARK MISSION), Graham Hancock (FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS), and others. But in style and substance there's simply no comparison between those authors' books, and this one.I have to admit that from time to time I will be pondering MYSTERY OF THE ANCIENTS, but not in connection with the supposed exploits of the Mayans. Rather, I'll be wrestling with the conundrums: Was this for real? I mean, the authors have genuinely done substantial research in assembling a catalogue of unexplained stuff to attribute to the Mayans. Or was it written tongue-in-cheek? Was it a straight-faced parody of ""ancient astronaut"" books? Did the Umlands, perhaps, have some connection to the National Lampoon? Mysteries that may never be resolved..."

The author approaches the story, not as a historian describing names, dates, motives and inconsistencies in the records, but as a story teller. He focuses almost entirely on the land battles from the United States point of view, reserving descriptions of the air and sea fighting to its impact on the land forces. I enjoyed this book. The author's approach moves the narrative briskly. I learned new information about the battles that were lost in the detail of other works.

The publication provides an English translation together with the Latin text on facing pages. More than 200 page of commentary were added to the 1983 edition, providing paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of Duns Scotus's reasoning following the text. Unfortunately, the quality of the binding of my copy was not very good. The book began to fall apart almost as soon as I opened it. However, there is no other publisher providing anything comparable.

This book covers the same material. Luthman talks about the correct relationship and understanding between masculine and feminine forces inside an individual, and also in the outside world (""sexual polarity"" as described by David Deida), which have been the single most important factor in my personal development and happiness, and also my lifelong obsession. Here the ""masculine"" element refers to the aspects that are active, rational, single-pointed consciousness and production-driven, while the ""feminine"" aspects are receptive, intuitive, diffuse consciousness and pleasure-driven. When these forces are in correct relationship the masculine's goal and primary source of meaning and fulfillment lies in service to the feminine and to its pleasure goals, while the feminine's goal and primary source of meaning lies in maximizing its own pleasure and the pleasure of the masculine partner. Each force (or individual) must be continually giving the other feedback and relating to it, and when this is done correctly the power generated by the interaction is mind-blowing. David Deida says something like (I paraphrase): ""men without women tend to be flat and boring; women without men tend to be unfocussed and emotionally self-indulgent"". Of course we all have masculine and feminine elements and so we all have to deal at times with these traits (flat and boring, and emotionally self-indulgent). Also all couples sexually-polarize to a greater or lesser degree and therefore this dynamic is present in gay couples also. These concepts are very controversial but extremely powerful. My teachers in this area include Shirley Gehrke Luthman, David Deida, and Victor Baranco and the Lafayette Morehouse. I also recommend David Deida ""For my lover"" and Steve and Vera Bodansky's books (Steve and Vera were students of Victor Baranco)."

Smith, Professor of Ethnicity and Nationalism at the London School of Economics, is perhaps the best overview of the many theories of nationalism in one volume. As a sort of sequel to his first book, _Theories of Nationalism_, Smith summarizes each major theory and offers his critique. He spends a good amount of time on the seminal theories of Ernest Gellner and Elie Kedourie plus has significant sections on John Armstrong, Benedict Anderson, Michael Hechter, EJ Hobsbawm, Tom Nairn and many others, including himself. Each chapter is organized by theme, starting with the grand old men of sociology, Durkheim and Weber, moving through the modernists, primordalists, perennialists and ethno-symbolists before ending with the postmodernists. (If you've never heard of some of these distinctions before, Smith spells them out quite clearly and succintly in the conclusion.)This book is thus valuable for all students of nationalism, even if you don't agree with Smith's critiques: his summaries alone make the book worthwhile."

The one major fault of this book is that, like most of the literature on nationalism, Smith is better at defining what nationalism is not than what it actually is. His differentiation between ""ancient"" ethnies and ""modern"" nations is critical, but muddled; his assertion of a direct relationship between these two concepts is less flexible than the rich tapestry of contemporary nations deserves.

I guess that everyone working in ""religion and science"" dreams about giving these lectures one day. In this extraordinary book, Larry Witham describes the history of the Gifford Lectures. There is absolutely no book like this! Years ago, Stanley Jaki wrote a slim book on the Gifford Lectures, but Witham's book surpasses it by far.In a sense, since the Gifford Lectures are so bound up with the whole field of science and religion, the story of the Gifford Lectures mirrors the history of the dealings of intellectuals to come to terms with both religion and science. Writing the history of the Gifford Lectures is writing the history of the science and religion debate.Witham's book is written in an engaging style, mixing journalistic description with interviews and personal descriptions. The book is well-researched. However, one of the things that make it absolute necessary reading to anyone interested in religion and science is the appendix, in which Witham lists all those who have given the Gifford Lectures from 1888 until 2005. Not only are the dates and titles of the lecturers listed, but also the publications which resulted from the lectures. Many of them have become classics in theology or philosophy.A truly admirable book, and an excellent starting point to engage in the interesting and lively interaction of religion and science. Buy it and convince yourself! You will not be disappointed.And if you finished this book, you will definitely want to read Witham's other books, ""When Darwin Meets the Bible"" and ""By Design"" - all available from Amazon.com.

This book describes the origin and history of the lectures, but it does much more than that. The lectures are grouped by period (into four chronological ""acts"" as the author calls them), and within each period the lectures are discussed in the context of the major intellectual currents of the time. The content of a lecture series is not simply summarized, but the reasoning of the lecturer is explained by reference to what he or she was seeking to add to an ongoing argument and to advance the understanding of a discipline by the audience and by the wider public. The impact of the lectures on the discipline is also explained.Larry Witham has studied the lectures and is able to identify and explain the reasoning of the author in a clear and understandable fashion. This is not to say that the book can be skimmed through and the content absorbed. The book is substantial and should be read carefully as there is much in it worth pausing and pondering.The book contains just over 300 pages of well-written text. An appendix includes a listing of every Gifford lecture, where and when it was given, the title of the book in which the lectures were published (or the title of the lectures if they were not published, which is uncommon) and the lecturer's affiliation.This is a stimulating volume that would be a welcome gift to anyone interested in the development of modern thought."
0195032748,Mao's Harvest: Voices from China's New Generation,,A28LG2MEWGLKZW,Jonathan S. Kemp,0/0,4.0,1175817600,An interesting glimpse at the New Realism movement,"In Mao's Harvest (1983), Helen Siu and Zelda Stern have gathered a collection of poems, stories, and essays from the New Realism literary movement in China. The authors of these works are part of the so-called ""Mao Generation."" Born in the 1940s, their entire lives have been affected by Mao's politics and policies. Mao's rule over China was highly ideological in its purported celebration of the masses and their labor, but the ninety percent of the population that was not directly affiliated with the CCP struggled to live any kind of prosperous life, let alone one that was not marred by poverty. As a result, the writers of the Mao Generation in Mao's Harvest express a deep disillusionment with the Chinese political system.Their surprisingly candid works are from 1979-1981, a period which Siu and Stern describe as ""a thaw in which the usual political controls on writers were relaxed..."" Thus most of the writing took place only three years after Mao died and the Gang of Four was arrested, an event which many historians consider marks the end of the Cultural Revolution. The excellent introduction to Mao's Harvest discusses the Cultural Revolution and its effects on Chinese youth at great length. Siu and Stern believe that the it created deep divisions between communities, families, and individuals, and that it epitomized the debilitating effects of Maoism not just on a person's economic or educational well being, but on their relationships to others and their views of the world. Ultimately Siu and Stern think that the New Realism movement of 1979-1981 reflects the disappointment, anger, confusion, and search for meaning that occurred among hundreds of millions of Chinese young people who lived under Mao's policies and the authoritarian structure of the CCP.Mao's Harvest is divided into six thematic parts: faith, family, love, work, politics, and an appendix of short political essays. Each part contains roughly four to ten works, with a large focus on stories and poems. Fifteen authors are represented, and their writings successfully reflect part of Siu and Stern's thesis: that the writers of the New Realism movement wrote stories and poems that show individuals struggling with the failures of the communist system. But another part of their thesis--that the New Realism movement is representative of the larger Chinese population and their disillusionment--is not entirely persuasive. But perhaps that idea is evident from the tumultuous history of China that can be read in many other books about the ongoing rule of the CCP. The writings in Mao's Harvest at least strongly suggest a profound disagreement between the people and those who led them. This is manifest by many of the stories' and poems' focus on the shattering effects of the ""corruption, opportunism, and bureaucratism"" on Chinese families.For example, in Part I, ""Faith"", Pan Xiao writes about her initial devotion to communist ideals. As a young student, she was exhilarated by heroic stories of workers who live only for the greater good. The stories were inspirational, and they gave her an adoring belief in the soaring ideologies and idealisms of Marxism. But as she got older, she saw that little in reality resembled such ideals. ""The reality my eyes saw always sharply contradicted what my mind had been educated to accept. Soon after I entered primary school, the waves of the Cultural Revolution began and grew more and more terrifying...Shall I believe in the books or in my eyes? I felt full of contradictions.""This essay, more than any other in Mao's Harvest, supports Siu and Stern's claim about New Realism reflecting a broader discontent among youths in Chinese society. This is verified by the reaction of the public to the Pan Xiao essay, which appeared in the magazine China's Youth. More than forty thousand letters poured into the editorial office of the magazine in the months after Pan's publication. Many people who responded strongly identified with Pan's confusion, sharing stories of their own disillusionment and discontent. The incredible response to Pan Xiao's essay does the most to show that it may not have been just the authors of New Realism who were upset by China's recent history; the public was upset as well.But while Siu and Stern allude to a widespread readership of that essay, there is little information about the effect of the other works in Mao's Harvest. Were they read by millions, thousands, or hundreds? How did people react to, for example, poems by Gu Cheng or stories by Zhang Jie? We often are not told how the stories were published. Knowing whether a story was published in a newspaper, magazine, or as a book would do much to explain the impact and importance of the New Realism movement.Nevertheless, the works allude to a larger discontent, and, if nothing else, show an enormous dissatisfaction among the authors themselves. In the ""Politics"" section, poet Ye Wenfu writes of a party member's selfishness:""You want everythingFor your pleasureFor your fancy...Want everything,You want everything!WhyDo you simply not wantThe Oath you took when you joined the party?""Ye Wenfu is also angered by the party's strict control of people's thoughts in his poem, ""In the Wake of the Storm"":""Finally I sincerely hopeThat future poetsWill no longer have this powerless angerWhen seventy-two pairs of eyesOvergrown with seaweed and red coralTightly fix their gaze on your pen""Siu and Stern have picked representative selections of the New Realism movement that are interesting both for their content and historical context. Considering the CCP's strict control over dissenting opinions, it is surprising that such candid material was allowed for a short period of time. Siu and Stern are quick to point out that the outpouring of creative expression and opposition was probably not a strictly benevolent act by the party on behalf of the people. It was most likely a political one meant to expose the failings of the new leadership's former rivals in order to build support. By 1981, what little literary freedom existed was mostly eradicated, and authors were left to write and publish anonymously or to not write at all. Mao's Harvest has biographies for all of the authors, and several of them have since cut back on writing.While Siu and Stern's selections certainly reflect disenchantment, they are not always excellent from a technical point of view. In the section titled ""Love"", the two stories and one poem are sentimental, perhaps even maudlin. There is little subtlety given to the themes or characters. In the story ""Love Cannot Be Forgotten"" by Zhang Jie, the main character starkly confesses her feelings of loneliness to the reader in such a way that evokes little feeling of sympathy. And in ""The Corner Forsaken by Love,"" Zhang Xian writes in a bombastically awkward manner, with characters openly proclaiming their emotions in strange situations.This is not to say that all of the works are poorly written. Many of the poems could stand on their own without the context of the New Realism movement. And the longest story in the book, ""Overpass"", is a real page turner. But overall Siu and Stern have placed the works' relevance to the political sphere ahead of their actual literary quality. Given the relative artistic freedom of 1979-1981, I am led to believe that there were thousands of stylistically innovative stories and poems being written, and some of them are probably written with more skill than many of the selections in Mao's Harvest. But as Jonathan Spence points out in the preface, the literary qualities of the works are much less important than the larger culture they describe. I mostly agree with him; Siu and Stern are clear in their introduction that these works are meant to demonstrate the New Realism movement's origins, content, and context. What is most important about these selections is their relevance to China's recent political history. Nevertheless, it is fair to criticize the literary merits of the works in Mao's Harvest, considering that they comprise most of the book.Ultimately, Mao's Harvest mostly succeeds in Siu and Stern's intentions. The poems, stories and essays amply showcase the Mao Generation's criticisms of the Chinese social system in the context of the New Realism movement of 1979-1981. The works are clearly relevant, as evident by Siu and Stern's excellent introduction and their choice of thematic organization. But the claim that the authors of the New Realism movement reflected a nationwide discontent among China's youth is not absolutely convincing, although it is likely in light of Pan Xiao's essay and many stories' focus on various families' struggles. Not all of works are well written, and some of them would likely not be published were they not so relevant in capturing an important moment of Chinese artistic freedom, but their cultural significance is paramount to the moments of prosaic writing."

0141803738,Thin Man (Classic Crime),,A16EJ2ZX9QERZ9,Shadow Woman,9/13,5.0,968716800,I LOOOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"The Thin Man, Dashiell Hammett's high-society detective novel, is most definitely NOT like the movies based on the book. While the movies are about a gay, carefree couple who solve crimes and do a lot of social drinking, the book is more about a couple in a destructive relationship. Nick only married Nora for her money, and they both know it. He's also a womanizer and an alcoholic (as is Nora). Nora is a younger woman who seems enchanted by Nick's sinful ways, and allows him to use her as he feels free to. The whodunit mystery, although discussed very much in the book, is not the most interesting part of the novel, nor did Hammett intend it to be. Read it for the satirical potrayal of bad relationships. Not just Nick and Nora's, but the dysfunctional (although dysfunctional may be an understatement) family they help to solve the murder.The Thin Man is also notable for the use of a certain word to describe male arousal. Hammett was attempting to pave the way for other authors to discuss sexuality more openly. Unfortunately, it didn't quite catch on."
0141803738,Thin Man (Classic Crime),,AHUT55E980RDR,Neal C. Reynolds,4/6,4.0,1027555200,Heavier weight than it first appears,"This book actually is worth reading a couple of times. Read it the first time for fun, but then reread it to see what you missed seeing the first time around.You probably know the basic plot. A former private eye has given up on the detective work after his wife has inherited her father's businesses, and is running her financial affairs for her. On vacation, they run into his former acquaintances and, of course, a mystery develops which he reluctantly is persuaded to investigate.There are a lot of undertones here. The obvious fact is that both husband & wife are slipping into alcoholism, although he's ahead of her. He has lost interest in what was once his very life. He apparantly slips out on her on occasion, and she seems to tolerate it...they obviously love each other. But he's not the man he once was. He's going to avoid violent confrontations and he takes the easy way out. His drinking habit, his unwillingness to exert himself in solving a crime, the fact that the only noticeable cheating on Nora is at a party where the other woman apparantly drags him off...all this indicates a once vital person such as Sam Spade or, to compare with another author's detective, Phillip Marlowe who is losing interest in life.I wonder if this book didn't inspire Raymond Chandler's idea for POODLE SPRINGS which opens with Phillip Marlowe's having married a wealthy woman. Chandler only wrote four chapters before his death and Robert Parker finished it, showing Marlowe as too rough hewn a character to settle into the wealthy life style.But Nick Charles gave in to it, and maybe was worse off for doing so.This isn't the strongest of Hammett's books, but it sure is worth reading and wondering a bit about."

It's fast-paced, witty, and, as someone else in here said, the mystery's not the thing. The banter is. Enjoy."

0141803738,Thin Man (Classic Crime),,A1BGE3EXIJ42XA,"Chris ""Okie""",0/0,5.0,1356652800,Great noir mystery. Not super gritty but full of wit and humor,"The Thin Man was Dashiel Hammet's final novel. It sticks with the familiar hard boiled themes and motifs common in his previous works like the Continental Op series or The Maltese Falcon. There are scenes showcasing the gritty underbella of prohibition era America and the thugs and speakeasies of the time. Where the Thin Man takes a different tack is that our main hero is a ""retired"" detective Nick Charles. Nick got married 4 years ago to Nora, a rich socialite from the West Coast. When Nora's father died, Nick left detective work behind and has taken on some responsibility for overseeing the businesses. Granted, his level of ""oversight"" seems to involve hobnobbing, spending money and doing a lot of drinking.The novel is set during Christmastime in New York City. Nick and Nora are enjoying a luxurious vacation when Nick runs into Dorothy, the daughter of a family he did detective work for years ago. Her father, Wynant is missing and she wants Nick to help find him. Nick says he's retired and gives her some ideas of who she might call. A bit later it is revealed that Wynant's secretary has been found murdered.Wynant's family members and associates keep turning up asking Nick to help find Wynant. The police also try to rope him into helping them solve the murder. More and more details are revealed and more suspects keep turning up. One of the suspects ends up shooting Nick and Nick decides he can't stay out of the investigation any more and starts gumshoeing. He still tries to defer to the police where he can and keep the press at bay as they try to get him to admit to working the case.Nora is enthralled with seeing her husband work and she keeps trying to push herself into the action alongside him. I love the banter between Nick and Nora. They are both so witty and sarcastic. It's a lot of fun to see them tease each other and especially fun when they're teasing in front of other characters or teasing other people. A lot of the other characters don't seem to know what to make of the Charleses. It's pretty funny.While this is still a gritty murder mystery full of all sorts of suspects both from high and low society, it is definitely less grizzly than the Continental Op. There were action sequences but they weren't as intense or drawn out as in Hammet's other works. The tone and action was closer to Maltese Falcon than the Op books.I really enjoyed the mystery of this book. There are a ton of little nuances and extra layers that add to the complexity. While some of the characters felt a little flat and stereotypical there were also a lot of very distinctive and interesting characters. Wynant's family members are each very outrageously distinct and quirky. Wyant's lawyer and business associates are a little more predictable but still interesting and add flavor.As with a lot of these early mystery novels, the final revelatory narrative is a bit drawn out with Nick going into a lengthy monologue explaining just what happened and how and by whom. I did like the humor that Hammet brought into this scene through short comments between Nick and Nora as she questions just how it is that he knows these things. In some cases his response is that ""it's the only way that makes sense""...in other cases he comments that he's ""not sure"" but he suggests that by making deductive theories in one direction, it's sure to put pressure on the real guilty party and expose something they don't want exposed.All in all I really enjoyed this story. It was a funny, exciting and intriguing mystery tale. While the overall mystery elements were all actually pretty complex in their unraveling, the actualy resolution was quite simple and seemed to make a lot of sense once fully explained. In the end this made for a rather satisfying conclusion.After reading the book, I sat down with my wife and we watched the movie based on the book. I loved that Dashiel Hammet received top billing. The movie was pretty faithful to the overall plot of the book although it did start out providing significant back story prior to the introduction of the Charleses. This served as a good introduction to Wynant and his family and associates. I felt like this change was a good way of putting a face to a character (Wynant) who otherwise is almost always ""off screen"" but constantly talked about. They did make a significant change to the ""Dorothy"" character. In the book she's flighty, erratic and just possibly a little crazy. In the movie she seemed pretty grounded and she's engaged to be married (which introduced a new character but also got rid of her ""flirting"" with Nick). Most of the other characters and situations remained the same until the very end of the story. Rather than having the final revelation meeting happen in the room of Wynant's wife and family, Nick sets up a dinner party and invites all of the suspects to attend. During the dinner he announces that he's brought the killer in and expects to reveal him or her there. The dinner party scene certainly made for better theater by adding more tension and suspicion as well as providing more opportunity for situational humor.Overall I really enjoyed this book. I've had a lot of fun reading Hammet's works and I look forward to reading more. If you're in the mood for a ""Noir"" mystery without as much grittiness but with just as much intrigue and fun, The Thin Man is definitely a good place to start.*****4.5 out of 5 stars"

Lieutenant John Guild visits Nick and tells him about the case (Chapter 11). Clyde Wynant sent a letter to his lawyer from Philadelphia (Chapter 12). Is the story about Alfred G.

We learn more about some people's past. Mimi, the former wife of Clyde, has something new to say (Chapter 23). Wynant called his lawyer Macaulay for a meeting (Chapter 26). There is a new development when Wynant's son Gilbert gets a letter (Chapter 28). Then Mimi tells about what happened (Chapter 29). Lieutenant Guild shows up with more news, and there is a solution (Chapter 30). The loose ends are tied up in Chapter 31. Nick explains how a theory of murder is created from what makes sense from the known facts. They can't wait for ""every little detail"".This 1972 paperback book cover has a picture of Dashiell Hammett, a thin man in real life. This fast-paced and very readable book was one of Hammett's best novels (""The Maltese Falcon"" was the other). It was also his last novel. His later years were spent in Hollywood working on film scripts. The film of this novel was also excellent, although changed for a visual media and simplified. Its success led to a series of films, as happens with other popular films. This 75-year old novel also tells something about life in those days."

The humor that was such a wonderful part of the movies only occasionally shows up in the book. The witty dialog between Nick and Nora is pretty much absent as well. In short I was pretty disappointed. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Nick and Nora movies I would have enjoyed the book. If you like old detective stories you will probably enjoy it.

Unlike `The Maltese Falcon' which had a mean and lean quality to it with characters you can't forget, his last novel seemed padded and most of his characters uninteresting. He wastes four and a half pages in telling the story of cannibalism in the old west. This would be a good technique if the story related to the current story. For example, if the story mentioned some treasure that disappeared and now people are getting killed because of the treasure. This is one of those rare times that I liked the movie rather than the novel.I gave `The Thin Man' two stars. Even though I was disappointed with this novel, Hammett is still better than the people who try to imitate him. I guess that his time working as an operative for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency put a little edge in his writing. As a wanabe writer, I know you can do research and try to make things realistic, but if you have lived what you are writing about - you can put in all those little details that will let your readers know that you have `street cred'"

Hall ""UniverseHall""",1/5,3.0,1206662400,The Thin Man,"There's always a problem with reading a book when you've already seen the movie version of it. You may be imagining characters that are different from the way they were described in the book - imagining dialog and nuances that just aren't in the book - and remembering scenes that you liked better the way they were in the movie.Those are all problems that I dealt with when I was reading this book. Not only have I previously seen The Thin Man (starring the ever-so-classy William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles) - I grew up watching it. I have probably seen it a hundred times.While I did my best to just say that this is a totally different experience and I should try to forget the movie while I read it - I spent a lot of time involuntarily judging the book against the movie. I couldn't help it.Well, if you're a fan of the movie, let me just say this: the book is a lot more raw than the film.The plot is essentially the same. Some minor details are changed. Some scenes take place in different places than in the film, and some characters are slightly different, or important for different reasons.But in the book, there is ""language"" (in the sense that censors use the term), implications of sexuality and more violence. The character of Dorothy Wynatt (who is essentially a heroine in the film) is definitely not so heroic in this. Nick is still smart and suave, but he's a little less classy than in the film.There is also a long, inexplicable section in the center of the book where Nick tells Gilbert (the eponymous Thin Man's son) the tale of Alfred Packer, North America's first cannibal. (You can see this tale colorfully illustrated in Matt Stone and Trey Parker's film ""Cannibal: The Musical!"" if you have any interest in it). This story relates in no way to the plot of the book, so I really don't know why it's there, if other than to assist the author in making a minimum page count.Looking at this book as a thing totally disassociated from the film, I can tell you this: yes, it was entertaining. Yes, it held my attention. It was a good way to while-away a couple rainy afternoons, but I can't tell you that I'd call it a great work of literature. And the thing that I liked the most about the movie (which, honestly, is mainly the characters of Nick and Nora) was a bit lacking in the book. It dwelt mostly on the Wynatt family, which was more twisted than in the film.It was good for what it was - a mystery novel. But I won't tell you that if you love the movie (as I do) that you'll love the book."
0141803738,Thin Man (Classic Crime),,A1F3DFRPGVEUI8,Sam Sattler,1/5,3.0,1200528000,Booze and Broads,"Being almost completely unfamiliar with the old Nick and Nora Charles movies, I came to The Thin Man with no preconceived notions about its two main characters and how they might fit into the rest of Hammett's body of work. At first, the book did not strike me as being particularly dark or hardboiled, two qualities I have come to expect from Hammett's writing, but by the time I finished it I had changed my mind. As Hammett developed his storyline and fleshed out his characters it became apparent that the more sophisticated Nick and Nora were dealing with characters from the criminal underworld and the NYPD who would have fit comfortably into any Hammett novel.Ex-detective Nick Charles and his wealthy young wife have come from San Francisco to spend Christmas 1932 in New York City, a city with which Nick is very familiar and in which he still has many friends and contacts because of the years he worked it as a private detective. Nick, retired from the business and hoping to earn his keep these days by managing the enormous wealth that his new wife has inherited, wants nothing more from the holiday than a chance to visit old haunts, see a few friends, drink some good booze on a regular basis and sleep until noon each day.A chance encounter with the daughter of a former client of his who wants him to help her find her father makes sure that most of Nick's original holiday goals will be impossible to achieve because, try as he might to avoid any involvement, he is slowly sucked into a mess beyond his imagination. Before he knows what hit him, Nick is working with a NYPD detective on a murder investigation, becomes the target of one of the murder suspects, finds that the wife of another suspect is trying to frame him for the murder, realizes that he and Nora have become surrogate parents to the young lady who first got him involved, and is still trying to squeeze in as much booze as possible into his daily routine.The Thin Man was Dashiell Hammett's last novel and I had hoped to enjoy it much more than I did. Strangely enough, what will stay with me the longest is the alcoholism that the novel's main character, Nick Charles, so obviously suffers, suffers to such a degree that he is constantly joking about his need for a drink and offering drinks to others so that he will have an excuse to mix one for himself. In fact, his young wife Nora, if she stays with Nick too many years, is almost certainly going to end up in the same boat. Hammett, an alcoholic himself, portrays these drinking habits as humorous and sophisticated, very much a positive thing in the lives of Nick and Nora Charles. I found that attitude, along with some casual use of the ""N-word"" to be distracting enough to keep me from fully buying into the novel's plot. I realize that the book was written at least 75 years ago but I struggled to get past this kind of thing, especially Hammett's attempt to make alcoholism seem so appealing a lifestyle.I listened to the audio version of the book and I was impressed with the way that William Dufris read the novel. The Thin Man is largely a first person narrative by Nick Charles with the remainder of the book being told in conversational format. Dufris does a superb job providing accents, inflections and different voices for the various characters, male and female, and made listening to Hammett's story a pleasure but, overall, I was disappointed in the book. Based on its reputation, I think that I expected too much."

It appears to me that The White Castle is, beyond being merely a reflection on identity and the nature of subjectivity, a self-reflexive interrogation of the Western novel. I can't help but feel that much of the novel is concerned with the psychology of the writer- writing in the White Castle seems to be an act of ablution and exorcism, a means to externalize and project one's guilt upon a sheet of paper. The examples of confessional works abound in modern letters- Rousseau's Confessions, Dostoevsky's Notes From The Underground, Camus' The Fall, Rimbaud's Season In Hell, most of Henry Miller's work, Pessoa's Book of Disquiet, Proust, Gide, Genet- literature has always had a purificatory/cathartic function.Of course, it is this sense of irrevocable, indestructible guilt that the author brings with him to Istanbul, along with all the Renaissance humanist concepts of the soul and the inalienable dignity of the sovereign individual. This humanism, of course, would later evolve into the Enlightenment variant that we have effectively inherited- the individual as self-sufficient, self-aware substance, with a number of invariable traits and properties. In the light of the works of Derrida and Foucault, Pamuk's work hardly seems to break new ground. His questions are, to us postmoderns, quite familiar- can one speak of a stable, invariant 'core' of subjective experience? are we merely just walking agglutinations of inherited cultural presuppositions, half-digested texts and hazily-recalled memories? can one ever speak the 'truth' about oneself? can one excavate, from this nebulous morass of discontinuous reveries, imaginings and memories, an impermeable essence that attests to one's absolute singularity?I think it is these questions that haunt our friend Hoja as he subjects Polish peasants to interrogation. Beyond the pleasure that he derives from being a confessor (and this voyeuristic jouissance is what all novel-readers relish), he is tormented by a conviction that the soul exists, that we are something more than superfluous receptacles of sensory stimuli and arbitrary recollections. Here, psychology is born. This obsessive desire, nay, DEMAND for Truth (with a capital T) and Knowledge (of the irrevocable, essential differences that separate 'us' and 'them', eerily foreshadowing Huntington's myth of the 'clash of civilizations') is characteristic of our civilization, and, as Said has so elegantly demonstrated, is inextricable with the exercise of Power. Hoja, beyond being a naive and bumbling positivist, is veritably Promethean in his insatiable yen for knowledge- he dreams of a day when his comprehensive taxonomies and scientific treatises will be used for world conquest. Again, one cannot help but think of Said's magisterial 'Orientalism', which thoroughly probes the intimate relationship between 'scientific' discourse and governance.Hoja's monomania separates him from his kin, who, instead of concerning themselves with originary principles and eternal verities, still live in a world of symbols and analogy. One of my favorite episodes in the book is one concerning the plague- the author meditates upon his enveloping fear of death, while Hoja speaks brazenly about his acceptance of celestial decree. If one dies, one is fated to die, why fight it? Allah has assigned us all a destiny, Hoja proclaims, inspirited by his stoicism. Yet, as he converses at length with the author and ponders over his propositions, he begins to reflect upon this position, one that he had never entertained doubts about previously. This encounter with the West casts all his heretofore sacrosanct values in question, and this dialogical dialectic goes both ways- the author gradually assumes Hoja's world as his own. As the Proust quote at the front of the book proves, and as the old saying goes, the grass is greener...Cue Hegel- the opposites pass into each other. Of course, there is no tidy aufheben into a unitary synthesis- Hoja and the author don't become a composite whole, nor do they survive their encounter intact, each wiser than before. Instead, what we are left with is a Derridean situation- the precarious margins between them become dangerously unstable, and they become increasingly indiscernible from one another. This dialectical waltz continues until the close of the book.I can't say that I loved this book- the prose is often opaque and the narrative is often crowded with (seemingly?) unnecessary detail. Indeed, it is this 'show without telling' dimension of Pamuk's style that is reminiscent of Kafka, but for the life of me I can't find the Kafkaesque humor that some of the other reviewers have spoken of. However, the better segments (the expedition to Poland, the conclusion of the novel) are outstanding. It does feel a little bit dated in '08 (and this, perhaps, doesn't bode well for the future, a strange outcome for a book that was published less than 3 decades ago), though this might have something to do with my weariness with 'postmodern' narrative. This is my first Pamuk novel, and I shall be moving on to 'The New Life' next. Hopefully that one is better."

For me it was one of the few assigned readings I had ever enjoyed! Whether a student of Middle-Eastern sociopolitical history or of psychology Orhan Pamuk has much to offer to his readers in &quot;The White Castle.&quot; In one short piece he has managed to tell the story of the fall of one of the greatest empires in the annals of history. Moreover he tags a personal message into the plot without disturbing the whole portrait painted in the narratives (i.e. Hoja's &quot;weapon&quot; that fails the Turks in the end may signify his own political views on 20th century Turkish society and government). Pamuk's modern style of writing upon an age-old topic of &quot;Western Christendom&quot; vs. the &quot;Islamic World&quot; immediately drew me into the book, momentarily making me forget I had a paper to write afterwards. I had not seen such an original (to me) take of cultural history since Josephine Tey's &quot;The Daughter of Time.&quot; Although the scarcity of dialogue may conjure up images of the scholarly treatises by Edward Said the novel does not seem to need it at all. Pamuk perfectly portrays the thoughts, emotions, and struggles of the characters through a first-person narration which he uses throughout the book (his description of the plague was particularly memorable). The issue of identity is a much tougher subject due to its more subjective nature, but it does seem that Pamuk greatly stress the importance of personal accomplishment, appropriate knowledge, and cultural mindset in forming one's character. However, the answer to such a deep question is best left to the individual reader. I hope that many others will pick up this book of their own volition as I probably will not have found it if it wasn't a part of my college course."

Engaging with it was like chewing whole-grain bread after so much pap; hard work, but with welcome appreciation of its intellectual density. In its historical setting, color, and focus on the life of the mind, it resembles the hermetic intensity ofMY NAME IS REDrather than the later SNOW. Oddly enough, though from an entirely different world, I also thought ofTHE NEW YORK TRILOGYby Paul Auster, who plays similar games with identity and the metaphysics of the writing process.The story is easy to summarize. A young Italian scholar, unnamed throughout the book, is captured by Turks in the Adriatic and taken to Istanbul. Like a junior Leonardo a century or more later, he has some knowledge of science, astronomy, and the arts, which serve to distinguish him from the other captives, so that he ends up as the slave of a similarly-minded Turkish savant known only as Hoja (master). Before long, they are telling each other all they know, and collaborating in devising firework displays and other marvels for the Pasha and later the young sultan, Mehmet IV. Many decades later, they travel with the Sultan's army in an attack on Poland, escorting a huge siege engine that Hoja has constructed. The army comes to a halt below a white castle, as unattainable as in a dream where ""you would run along a road twisting through a dark forest, straining to reach the bright day of that hilltop, that ivory edifice; as if there were a grand ball going on which you wanted to join in, a chance for happiness you did not want to miss..."". Their lives will not be the same again.On first seeing Hoja, the narrator is startled to observe that they might almost be twins, and the love-hate relationship that consumes them over the ensuing decades is almost like the rivalry between brothers. More than that, between two parts of the same self. For not only do the contributions of the two men become indistinguishable to outsiders, they become merged in their own minds also. After some years, they abandon their scientific dabblings and force each other to sit at opposite ends of a table writing manuscripts headed ""Why I Am What I Am."" Hoja finds this task increasingly more painful as he is forced to question himself; the Italian delves into childhood memories branching increasingly into fiction. Everything is shared between them until truth and fiction merge and one personality -- Christian or Moslem, master or slave -- has essentially become the other. By the end, not even the reader can be sure which is which.I make no claim to full understanding of this extraordinary novella. But I can recognize a writer with unique and disturbing ideas, not only about his own craft, but about the very nature of our identity."

With the seperate cultures but often common interests, there is a lot that's worthwhile in ""The White Castle"". However, I felt the book bogged down somewhat towards the end. Then it takes a major turn in the next to last chapter and wraps things up a bit too quickly (given the detail of the first 3/4's of the book).In the other book that I read by Orhan Pamuk (""Snow""), I could tell that the author was adressing the conflict between the modern Turk and the traditional Turk. There were two distinct characters in ""The White Castle"" that may have represented the same conflict. I wasn't quite sure that I was getting that from what I read but a sharper mind might pick that up (or something along those lines). I enjoyed the book but I was both surprized and disappointed by the way it ended. In an odd sort of way, maybe that's an endorsement."

Especially interesting, for me, are the writings of someone who is from a totally different culture then mine. (The only caveat, of course, is that the translator, has the ability to reproduce the original author's intent and not supersede them with their own. An example of a 'poor' translation would be the first translations of Kafka by the Muirs.)This book must have been a special problem for the translator because it is written in the first person, but supposedly, not by the author. It is also hard a times to determine the actual time sequence of the book. (The narrator talks about being captured by Turkish pirates and sold as a slave. He also talks about the attack on Vienna by the Ottoman Turks. But he also relates a story about 'American' red ants. So it would seem to be late seventeenth early eighteenth century.) You have to wonder, while reading this book, whether the translator had any idea of the sociology of the Turks during this time.OK, putting all this aside, is this a great book? I hope so, though at times I wondered at whether it was just a lot of ramblings of a pseudo-intellectual. But on the other hand, is this what Pamuk was trying to convey? Especially since he uses the device of this book having been written by the narrator and then ""found"" by the author (who is another person, not Pamuk); it begins to get a little murky. Maybe this accomplishment is what makes it great.The story itself is of course as straight forward as a river road. Are we really dealing with two people, or are we dealing with one person with two personalities...is this guy a schizo? (Or maybe, having finished this book, it's me who is now of two minds, so to speak...err type... err whatever.)Lastly, from my perspective, the book seems to read slower the farther you go on, so that the last chapter seems to go on forever. Is that boredom or greatness? You decide."

A Venetian sailor is captured by the Turkish pirates and is forced to convert to Islam. But he refuses to do so. He then is given as a personal servant to the emperor and is employed with the royal scholar Hoja, who is an exact physical resemblance of the narrator.Hoja tries to learn everything from the narrator, and slowly the mutual exchange of ideas makes them resemble each other more and more, until at last the reader absolutely cannot make any distinction between them. They are ordered to build a war machine to siege the white castle in the Carpathians, which they do but ultimately the machine fails and the only meaningful thing they do all this while is to know each other. At last the narrator returns to Italy, but the reader is not entirely sure whether it was really him or Hoja who returned. The White Castle is an attempt, rather a hope of making the West and the Middle-East meet. Pamuk sees the West as too inner-directed and the Middle-East as too outer-directed.Those who are familiar with Buddhism and Hinduism will know that the meaning of being inner-directed is entirely different from what the West means by it. For the West it means intensive individualism. For the East, it is a journey of self-exploration by meditation.So in The White Castle, the inner-directedness of the West means individualism at its best, and the outer-directedness of the Middle-east means materialistic totalitarian society, like that of the Ottoman times. Pamuk hopes that these two ends can meet.A brief look at the nature of Islam and Christianity makes it hard for us to believe that they indeed can meet. Both of these religions are the extreme forms of monotheism, bent upon world conquest through sword. Being extremely exclusivist they do not tolerate any difference, any idea of `the others'. Their followers meet only when their authority is slackened by local restraints, and as soon as it is again possible to oppose, they do. Even then, only the followers meet, not the respective religions.The White Castle is to be enjoyed for its style. Observer says about Pamuk, `Up there with the best of Calvino, Eco, Borges and Marquez'. This is very true about The White Castle. If you are prepared to delve into the late medieval times and the Ottoman alleys with a magical, exotic touch, then this is the book for you. Though this art form will be developed more thoroughly by Pamuk in his later book, I am Red, the reader will not be disappointed in this work."

This plot, as some have noted in other reviews, can at times be a bit dull. Lurking in the background, however, are a rich set of philosophical puzzles that lure the reader into a deeper interaction with the text and its introspections, and make The White Castle the warm and interesting novel that it is. Haji and the Italian's uncanny physical resemblance and the shifting and ultimately dissolving borders between their personalities beg us to question the meaning of identity. Their tempestuous relationship makes us wonder about the nature of love, and self-love. And the struggle between Turkish and Western knowledge, Haji's desire for Westernization, and the result of the battle for the eponymous white castle cause us to reflect on this struggle in Turkish history, and in the Turkish present. In the end, The White Castle is a novel that captures its reader not with an un-put-downable plot, but rather with its ruminations on the individual and collective 'self' and 'other'."

Turkey, by virtue of its geographical position in the world, has to deal with the question of IDENTITY on a daily basis and perhaps only such a country can produce writers like Pamuk and stories such as his. This novel on the exchange of values, opinions, and ultimately identity is well-written, absorbing and strangely disturbing. Peopled with fascinating characters and a plot which culminates in a chilling ending, Pamuk's offering is an unforgettable piece of literature."

My view is that anyone new to Pamuk will be left disappointed. I really enjoyed 'My Name is Red'. Sadly this novella was short of anything satisfying: no plot, cut out characters and periphiral interest. Pamuk was obviously trying to make a point about the narrator bearing such a close resembance to Hoja but he failed to connect with me. The relationship between the narrator and Hoja was painful reading and I never fathomed why Hoja should have such a hold over the narrator, portrayed in the early stages of the book as a highly intelligent and resourceful young man. Those with imaginative minds will find a pertinent underlying thread but whatever that may be the substance of the book is still bland."

Almaas.. Though I don't agree with everything he writes, I will use his most basic structuring of the person to comment on this novel. Almaas says (based on Plato, most likely) that a person IS his essence, and HAS a personality. The personality usually operates in a non-natural way, inflating itself as it tries to control itself and others. Almaas calls this the Impostor, which I think is a bit judgmental but the term works for analyzing The White Castle.I am not thinking Pamuk has read Almaas but maybe he has read Plato. Though who knows if he had that in mind when writing his Novel.Still, if the model of essence and personality has some truth to it, this should be revealed by any novelist who digs deeply enough into character. This is exactly what the White Castle does: digs into the nature of the character--what IS he truly, and what is his personality structure. The impostor struggles to keep it identity hidden, and stay in control of the person, rather than relax into a more natural way of being true.It is a sad novel, a tragedy, in that the personality never gains the truth of itself, but succeeds only in creating a lie and living it. It was difficult for me to finish. I got bogged down in the middle, as other readers mentioned. I think this is because our own personality recognizes the impostor in the story, and then we don't want to read more for fear of our own impostor being revealed. It takes effort to finish the novel. However, we may learn much from the tragic choices of others, this is why the genre of tragedy is still with us after several thousand years.I think ""the white castle"" is symbolic for a human being. In this case, the castle is not taken. The weapon to take the castle is poorly designed and bogs down in the mud, lost. This symbolizes the tragic end that the impostor remains in power of the person.I could be wrong of course but that is how I read it.I see The White Castle as similar to the tragic, A Turn of the Screw by James, and the likable story by Ursula K. LeGuin in her early short story, ""the diary of the rose"" in the collection, ""The Compass Rose.""Caution: Worth reading unless you are depressed, it might make you feel worse :) I don't think it would have been healthy for me to have read this book during my depressed decades.."

Sadly for me it just didn't quite make it. Whilst Jeff Shapiro managed to deliver great warmth and subtly in his first novel, something akin to a really good French film, in his second novel I felt the inevitable swing to pleasing / appeasing the 'Hollywood' market. For those who have read the ""Little World of Don Camillo"" books, it is a fine line between plot device and the overall integrity of the story, between characters of depth and complexity and stero types. Whilst so much of the writing is deeply and beautifully scribed, I found passages in this book frustrating and contrived. His characters are generally deep and have a feeling of authenticity, I especially loved his development of Cappelli and the wonderful Rosa Spina. There is much to like in this book but the final revelation by the young Moses was one step to far, an almost ticking off on religious plot devices. Simply not believable and unnecessary, especially in the midst of the 'Big Plot Reveal' which already stretched the readers credulity. Ho hum, I guess sometimes some things are just irresistible and this is when a good editor is needed....

Readers gain an intimate view of a pre-feminist world by reading her very private diary. A Southern Jewess who valued her Southern and Jewish origins equally, Apte lived a comfortable life and served as an articulate witness to vital events in early 20th Century American life. Apte's writing is beautiful and she makes even the most mundane subjects poignant with the quality of her insights and prose. A clear talent,she apparently failed to recognize her ability or chose - for one reason or another - to share it only with her diary. Fortunately for us, her grandson, who discovered the diary long after Apte's death, brought it to publication complete with a series of highly-informative supportive essays which help readers appreciate the times in which his grandmother lived. Apte was a true romantic and may have been one of the last Victorians. In many ways her values are so remote from ours today, that it's a stretch to appreciate her; which makes reading Heart of a Wife a satisfying exploration into real-life history."
0842027459,Heart of a Wife: The Diary of a Southern Jewish Woman,77.0,,,3/5,3.0,933638400,This book offers great insight about Jewish Women of the Sou,"Heart of a Wife: The diary of a Southern Jewish Woman opened up a window to a world that was completely foreign to me despite a common European Jewish heritage. Helen Jacobus Apte was born in 1886 Georgia and was first generation American but did not have any of the immigrant characteristics and values that I would have expected. She derived her set of values and standards from the dominant Victorian culture rather than from Jewish Tradition, yet she did have an important place in her heart for Judaism.She spoke of her intention as a new bride to light shabbat candles every week and we know that she was active in her temple and in Jewish Charities, but it is unclear if she did observe Jewish Rituals throughout her life. There is no mention of a seder and Rosh Hashana was referred to as &quot;The New Year&quot; with little elaboration. Marcus D Rosenberg, her grandson,acknowleges that &quot; Readers may find it curious that so little in it is identifiably &quot;Jewish&quot;. In some ways of course, everything in it is Jewish. Judaism was behind Helen's clearly liberal social conscience. Her Religion not only guided her views of life and death but also shaped her views of duty and responsibility.&quot;Helen's parents immigrated to the United States from Germany and I am amazed that her connections to her European past could have been so cleanly severed. I could not imagine a woman of her intelligence and supposed social consciousness would not be more aware of the the plight of European Jewry during the thirties and forties and not feel some connection to it. (If she did, she never mentioned it.) Rosenberg explains in his essay that Helen identified as a Southern American who happened to be Jewish&quot; and that was common in that time and Place.Marcus Rosenberg does a wonderful job of setting the historical context and establishing identities of family members. His essays offer great insight into the times and the events which influence her. I do think he has a more romantic image of his grandmother than she deserves. I was very disappointed by Helen Jacobus Apte. I thought that she had great talent and potential but was too self absorbed to have any positive effect on those around her, and certainly not on the world.Was Helen Apte truly a typical Southern Jewish Woman? I hope that she was not. She was the stereo-typical Southern Belle, spoiled , self-centered, with a constant case of the &quot;vapors&quot;. Although she alludes to world events, none of them seemed to touch her. Only &quot;The 1910 Cigar Strike,&quot; which affected her directly and financially, seemed to really matter. She was the center of her world, and she seemed to use her ill health to her best advantage."

Very much a coming-of-age story of Martin Jr. trying to cope with an emotionally distant father and a brother whose horizons are much broader than cattle and ranching. If you are a youth struggling to find yourself and the two most important men in your life (father and older brother) are not people you find yourself trying to be like, then you have to find your own way, make your own path. Eventually Martin Jr. does. Honor Thy Father has a complex plot but simple characters who are niether stereotypes nor overdrawn and who do not spend an inordinate amount of time questioning themselves, their motives, and their actions. There is enough romantic interest in the form of Leah, daughter of a neighboring rancher, and Mary, the part Arapaho daughter of a nearby retired trapper, to hold the interest of female readers. A lot of youthful males will identify with Martin Jr., whose first sexual experience is not at all what he had imagined. A good read and an author to go to again and again."

Rob Grant has taken some trends he perceives in modern society, extrapolated them ad absurdum, and had fun seeing how ludicrous he can make the consequences.The preface to ""Incompetence"" reads as follows:""Article 13199 of the Pan European constitution: `No person shall be prejudiced from employment in any capacity at any level by reason of age, race, creed, or incompitence'"" (Yes, the spelling mistake is deliberate - I wonder if Rob Grant had the same problem I did in preventing the software he was writing in from automatically correcting it !)""Incompetence"" is described as ""A novel of the far too near future"" and is set in a united Europe in which ""Non Specific Stupidity"" is a registered disability which cannot be used to hold back promotion prospects, waiters have Tourette's syndrome, airline pilots have vertigo, etc. The story is told through the eyes of an undercover agent who is not what he appears to be, on the tail of a mass-murderer who is all too competent.""Incompetence"" works well as humorous entertainment: it could be seen as supporting a political view (e.g. hostility to the European Union and to big government), but anyone who reads it for political reasons may be disappointed. And anyone from the US is thinking of buying it for a good laugh at the expense of the Europeans should be aware that the book turns round at the end and delivers a few bites in the other direction.Overall I found this book to be very amusing and highly recommend it.If you enjoy ""Incompetence"" because you enjoy funny writing, and not because you agree or disagree with any particular political view which may be satirised within it, then another book which you may also enjoy is ""Jennifer Government"" by Max Barry. However, the irony is that while these two books came out at the same time and use much the same type of humour, the trends which they extrapolate ad absurdum and the targets they take aim at are diametrically opposite.It says something about how complex the trends in our society are that Rob Grant in ""Incompetence"" and Max Barry in his book could use the same technique to satirise opposite trends and both books contain enough truth to be funny. Perhaps it also demonstrates that satire is so universal in its applicability as to be highly effective as a means of entertainment but much less so as a means of putting over a political argument."

There's a lot to like -- Grant is a funny writer, no question about it, and you can't help but sympathize with the hero in his battle to ferret out Klingferm's killer. But the solution to the mystery is a huge letdown. I won't tell you who-done-it, but let's just say the solution involves an evil American plan to impose on Europe the exact sort of rule-by-incompetent-bureaucrats that Grant has spent the whole novel satirizing.

The second half of the book is great physical humour and the first a lot of dealing with incompetent bureaucratic humour. Some of the scenes at the start do drag on a little bit such as the interactions with Captain Zuccho, the Italian policeman with anger management issues. Also I pictured the character as a bit older at the start then in the second half when he was a lot better at performing physical stuff like jumping onto a moving train and winning hand to hand combat lethal fights. He doesn't seem to have this badass ability at the start such as the shotgun garbage scene. I think this inconsistency in the character's abilities and traits (well basically the difference in competence levels of Detective Harry Salt) was deliberate and part of the incompetence theme joke of the novel and it worked well.Basic plot of Incompetence - Detective Harry Salt is an undercover agent. He is summoned from London to Italy by Klingferm, his controller for a face to face meeting with the other two agents Klingferm is responsible for. Salt has never met the other two agents and only met Klingferm in person once or twice, so this in the flesh meeting, must mean something major is going down. Set in the near future where the United States of Europe has passed a law expanding the normal discrimination act to also include no person shall be discriminated against no matter how stupid they are or incompetently they do their job. This means nothing runs smoothly from government departments including the police, to hotels, train stations, car rental agencies and everything in between. Various incompetent staff encounters luckily delay Salt's arrival time for the scheduled meeting and he misses out on being in an elevator that has shot out of the top of a building and come crashing down outside many floors below. Salt investigates much to the anger of Italian authorities and knows someone deliberately tampered with the lift's control buttons and it wasn't just an incompetent lift mechanic, which would have meant no possible prosecution. As Salt tracks the killer he must overcome various incompetents who either deliberately, or just through plain stupidity impede his every move."
B000N6MHK2,Incompetence,,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""",0/0,4.0,1255910400,Extremely funny,"In the all-to-near future, the European Union is well on its way to becoming a single federalised state. Unfortunately, due to the passing of Article 13199 of the Pan-European Constitution (""No person shall be prejudiced from employment in any capacity, at any level, by reason of age, race, creed or incompitence,""), the continent is grinding to a halt. One detective is assigned to track down a dangerous killer, but finds his investigation complicated by blind nightclub bouncers, octogenarian male lap-dancers, priapic train stewards and airline ticket salesmen with attention disorders.Incompetence, originally published in 2003, was the second original novel by Rob Grant, better-known to many SF fans as the co-creator of Red Dwarf. One of Grant's favourite topics, shown sporadically in Dwarf but reaching a kind of insane art form here, is the sheer, mind-numbingly unbelievable insanity that bureaucracy is capable of. Obviously the EU, with its perchance for fining corner-shop greengrocers who sensibly refuse to use measurements its customers find incomprehensible thousands of pounds for each infringement, is a tempting and irresistible target for his humour.The result is a book driven by the type of comedic raging fury of the kind that Basil Fawlty would have channeled should he have ever chosen to write a novel (although this would be an admittedly difficult task for a fictional character) about the European Union. Our 'hero' is on the trail of a deadly killer but the case is interrupted by every five minutes by increasingly bizarre and convoluted brushes with EU law or regulations. He hires a car, but in the interval between hiring it in the office and crossing the parking lot to where his hire-car is waiting for him, it's been clamped for being parked in the wrong place. Trying to get on a train takes 22 pages of insane, and at times life-threatening, wrangling. The police attempt to stop a runaway car but can't come up with a way of doing it effectively so end up deploying anti-tank weaponry. And so on.It's a very, very funny book. The laughs start on the first page and don't stop until the last. And it's not even as if the author is really succeeding at making a serious point about the EU. The situations the main character finds himself in are so insanely over-the-top they will almost certainly never happen, although there's a few that do seem somewhat plausible (like the one about the old guy who is accidentally declared dead and his wife receives a fat cheque from the government, so they decide to keep up the pretense he is dead).In addition to the non-stop comedy and satire, there are a few nice moments of understated writing as well. There's a blink-and-you-miss-it moment towards the end where our (unnamed, by the way, I haven't just forgotten what his name is) protagonist proves how competent he is, even if the rest of Europe isn't. And to be honest the main, more serious plot is never really given a lot of time to develop, due to the constant misadventures and brushes with bureaucracy along the way.But that's not too much of a problem. Incompetence (****) is extremely funny from start to finish and constantly entertaining. The book is available now in the UK, but unsurprisingly not in the USA (possibly for fear that Americans would accept it as a serious and well-informed factual book about the EU), although Amazon.com has some import copies available."
B000N6MHK2,Incompetence,,AC2L5LTX8GP1A,brainiac,1/2,2.0,1288742400,Depends on what you expect,"If, like me, you read the other reviews of this book, you would probably expect that it's a scathing indictment of political correctness, over-regulation of society, and government inefficiency. You'd probably also expect that it was riotously funny. I'm going to have to shoot a few arrows at those myths.Let me establish my bona fides: I'm a Red Dwarf fan, and as all proper fans I think the show declined greatly in quality when Grant left. And when I heard about this book I ordered it from England and waited impatiently for it to arrive ... only to be underwhelmed, then moderately enthused, then entirely let down.The book is somewhat about what people claim: a future united Europe that has a mind-crushing number of idiotic laws and regulations, culminating in the ridiculous law that people cannot be fired for being incompetent at their job. But this is really just a background hook. The primary storyline is a rather unimpressive spy tale, with the author writing in first person about himself being a super-spy for the EU, tracking down a killer he calls ""Johnny Appleseed"". The details of the case are rather boring and trite, and the author can't resist a few ego-boosting plot developments and character traits (at first he is described as fat, but his description slims down as the book continues, then he tels us he has a ""great ass"", and there is of course the scene where the impossibly hot and impossibly smart femme fatale falls for him within the space of five minutes).Weaving the story together are background tales of a cop with anger management issues, airlines whose pilots can't land planes, gigantic train stations that have no customers, and eighty-year-old male lap dancers ... all due to a gigantic and idiotic bureaucracy. There's even one bit where the hero is arrested and taken to a jail which is constantly being expanded downwards to house the ever-growing number of violators of innumerable, pointless laws.But with only a few exceptions, these scenes aren't particularly funny, and rarely rely on the hook. And some of them just drag on beyond the point of insanity. The bit about faking passing out to get a first class seat is genuinely hilarious, as is the description of the ill-fated dinner party. But the bit regarding jumping onto a train while it's moving lasts entirely too long, as does the end scene in a roller-coaster car. Most of the rest of the book is just unremarkable, marking time to fill pages.It's also a bit weird to try to figure out what Grant is trying to say, if anything, particularly given the ending. After spending the whole book running down the EU (and, bizarrely, engaging in constant ethnic slurs against Chinese people), Grant decides to make the villain an American spy randomly killing innocent civilians to disrupt the EU and make England the 51st state. Why? So he can engage in some bizarre anti-American rants, the most hilarious of which is when he tries to insult America for ""having its own national sports nobody else plays"". Um, right, nobody plays baseball and basketball. And soccer - the sport of which Europeans are so proud because the 'whole world plays it' - is only played around the world because of European imperialism. If the US took over every country and relegated their citizens to second- or third-class status, then forced them to learn American sports at gunpoint, those sports would be world sensations as well. Funny that a person who can drop bizarre facts around like a know-it-all at a party could be so culturally blind.So it's a bit of a drag. Overall a rather inconsequential and by-the-numbers spy story with an awful ending, and a few tales of incompetence and bizarre mishaps sprinkled in - some funny, some tiresome - to keep it rolling. Not exactly a travesty, but not a novel I'd particularly recommend."

Australian author Kaz Cooke is well known for her cartoons, films, and writing. Her humorous book provides delightful wisdom about a variety of female topics: nutrition, dieting, the fashion industry, and self-image to name a few. As Cooke says, &#65533;We want to find out how to stop seeing our bodies as the enemy. And hey, let&#65533;s face it, we wouldn&#65533;t mind a laugh while we&#65533;re at it.&#65533; Cooke manages to provide serious, thoughtful information in a casual, appealing manner. Because the text is divided by bold titles and subtitles, it is easy to pick it up and flip through to a subject of interest. The text is broken up by cartoons, quotes, and quizzes. One of the best parts of the book is the &#65533;Contacts&#65533; and &#65533;Further Reading&#65533; lists at the end of each topic. The book is sassy and fun, great for kids from 14-103.

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""",2/2,4.0,1111104000,Give Yourself a Break From Your Own Negativity,"Who is Kaz Cooke and why haven't I heard of her? Cooke is another creative artist from down under. The Australian writer, cartoonist, filmmaker and columnist has a slew of works to her name. She is the creator of Hermoine, the Modern Girl, a colourful caricature who's also featured between the pages of Real Gorgeous.Real Gorgeous is about body shapes, body parts, exercise, plastic surgery, fashion, dieting, advertising, modelling, eating disorders, responding to the body police and so much more. Yes, it's a women's book but it is often directed toward girls too. It touches on so many topics relating to the body and beauty; providing some research, some quotes and some of the authors own opinions. Each chapter has suggestions for further reading.Real Gorgeous isn't a fat book but a body image book. Anyone is sure to find at least one of the anecdotes in the shadow boxes, placed throughout each chapter, to relate to. If there's one thing, this book shows it's that body image issues are more of a global issue than just within our group of friends. Canadians, Australians, and Americans are all dealing with similar issues regarding body image. Body image issues are also not delegated to one body type. Fat people don't have the monopoly on bad body image.It acknowledges the impact of family, friends, media and self perception on body image. Cooke exposes the fashion and diet industry for what they are... People ""trying to sell you something."" She is quick to point out all the money we spend needlessly and what we're really getting for it. A real eye opener.Cooke summarizes a lot of points from others work to back up what she's saying. Not a page goes by without a quote from someone else. Many relevant quotes from Penelope Goward appear. There are quite a few anonymous quotes like, ""a New York make-up artist says..."" which I found irritating and at times caused me to question their validity.Sometimes it seems Cooke is checking to see if the reader is paying attention and will stick in nonsense comments, like during a listing of healthy eating she added, ""Don't stick popcorn up your nose."" Silly but unexpected and funny none the less.There's an excellent section called Body Image Boosters the reader can return to again and again for ideas on how to give yourself a break from your own negativity. One of my favourite sections is what to say to the ""Body Police"". You know those people who never really have anything nice to say to you or who offer a compliment with a negative tag on the end.Real Gorgeous is an informative, light read with many sections for the stop and start reader. It provides an alternative look at the body and beauty from a personal perspective and that of others. An excellent book to have around.Review Originally Posted at http://largeandlovely.bellaonline.com"

I have been having some body image issues lately. I pulled Real Gorgeous out again and reminded myself that I am beautiful--not in spite of--but because I am a curvy, soft woman. I need to get away from the constant bombardment of messages (from the media and other people) telling me I need to lose weight to be a worthwhile human being. I like the author's style of discussing all sorts of issues women face without condescention. The illustrations are delightful, too."

Busting the unrealistic self-image sold to (or stuffed into) us by media and corporations is a great intention. But the book runs to the opposite extreme.

Don't do anything, trust you body in its candy cravings and food selection and be happy, even if you ARE looking like a space-porker."" Excuse me, but our modern environment, food quality and living habits are far, far away from being normal. And to restore the balance, to get close to a slight resemblance of normal the huge work needs to be done, including strict restraining yourself from over-eating over-processed over-refined food and getting a lot and lot of exercise.

New books attempting to compete in this area haven't seen much success in recent years.As a college instructor, I find this new addition a really pleasant surprise. The style certainly is a notch above many other texts, yet the more important feature to me is the way theories are presented. While mathematical rigor is not compromised, a clear emphasis on fundamental principles and intuitive thinking has its great appeal, especially to students who have not had much experience with random variables etc. As claimed by the author, it is ``extremely instructor-friendly'' because of its Textgraph format. Indeed, the clever mixture of `viewgraph' with the in depth discussion in the book makes it very appealing for classroom use.Another feature is the carefully compiled problems including self-test problems that should be well received by motivated students. Reading chapter 5 has also been a quite enjoyable experience as it summarizes succinctly major applications of probability theory before it gets to the more advanced topics on random processes. The accompanied user-friendly software is also a plus --- being able to play with various probability concepts will certainly enhance greatly the students' understanding of the subject matter."

He does state essential points right up front, but not enough attempt is made to provide intuitive or common-sense explanations. Examples are mostly derivations of special cases. More useful examples are provided at the end of chapters, but they would be better if integrated with the text.

Rydberg,0/0,4.0,1154649600,The Answer Wanted or The Answers Needed?,"Every once in a while, spiritual journeys become the `in' thing to do. Yet it seems axiomatic that a spiritual journey that is predictable, comfortable, and fashionable is also equally vacuous. What happens when `the journey' has not only failed, but made matters worse, even unlivable?That is the question that Melissa Simonds examines in this, her first published work. When the path ends with the destination unreached, where does one go? (Full disclosure: I have become acquainted with the author, but well enough to know that she would appreciate nothing less than a full and honest evaluation.)`A Lifetime Ago' is about such a journey, where the results achieved differ markedly from what is popularly expected. The story revolves around Cami Taylor, who has endeavored to `remake' herself, inside and out. The paths chosen are those we often hear about in real life; Cami pursues inner contentment by reaching for outwardly standard accepted measures; attractiveness, success, fame, wealth, sex.In all these she has succeeded, but the goal remains elusive. We follow Cami as she navigates her path, seeing nothing unusual in her choices or desires. She reflects what is around us every day. But less common on TV and in magazines than the launching of self-discovery is the frustrating result that may create even greater misery. What was supposed to be a series of fulfilling pursuits resulting in a nirvana of self-actualization instead becomes a tangle of ecclesiastical dissatisfaction.The book is written in first-person prose with a slight south-western motif (Ms. Simonds and her heroine, Cami, are both from that region of the U.S.). The `dialect' is evident and not always what one expects in prosaic works. It can take a little getting used to but that comes quickly enough as a necessary part of the work. After all, despite her attempts to exorcise it, Cami will always be an `Arizona gal' at heart. The seemingly intrusive `desert' accent in cosmopolitan New York puts her divided personality on display as Cami tries to transplant her adopted persona in place of her real self and her real needs.The story is wonderfully written and well paced. We're prepared for each turn she approaches and nod to ourselves `yes, that makes sense' when her decision is reached (with one major exception late in the book). We experience peaks and valleys not through alterations or intensity of the verbiage, but in the telling of the tale and weaving of the mental picture. Events flow and speak for themselves, and we feel the experience, not merely react to the words.Cami's eventual answer, joyfully embraced, is not one that plays well on television or in the pages of `People.' It does bring to light what many instinctively know but refuse to acknowledge; it is the `unfashionable,' the overlooked or even avoided that holds the answer we seek. In the end, it is what Cami has put off, even put-down that becomes her final solace. The rest that she has tried before is left on the bonfire where, as the ancient author said, ""Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.""It has been said in many different ways that people are best refined through tribulation. We should not be astonished to find that the deepest answers may require great and surprising upheavals of our popular expectations and views."

The book nicely explains the advantages of just in time, why it works, how it relates to quality improvement processes, the effect on purchasing, how to link various cells using just in time, and how to put the concept into effective implementation.The book begins with a brief history of how just in time came into being, and how it became so popular. I found it interesting to see that lack of space in Japan played a role in the development. That factor would not have been enough without the effects of the quality movement based on Deming's principles there (defect-free goods are the way to create quality, good quality is more profitable than poor quality, buying from suppliers who are committed to quality, working with suppliers to improve quality, and quality requires top management commitment). The seminal experiences at Toyota in Japan are also related.Although it is a summary of the field, the level of detail is good. I particularly liked the section that compared just-in-time to other popularly-employed manufacturing processes. That made the differences and advantages clearer. I also enjoyed reading about the kanbans (ways of ordering production) that Toyota developed to create effective production flow without putting a lot of computer systems in place.Whether you are looking for personal curiosity, to begin an evaluation of whether or not you should use just in time, or want to teach the subject to someone, this is a good book for you.I also suggest that you visit plants that have just in time, in order to see how this is implemented. A good overview of the strategic advantages of just in time can be found in Michael Dell's book, Direct from Dell."

He is now 50-years-old and has returned to the place where he nearly lost his life during World War II. Cantwell is a bitter man, feeling that he was unfairly demoted after losing a major part of his brigade during a forest battle. He was actually following orders, and believes the Army simply needed someone to blame and chose him.He spends his time in Venice dictating his memoirs, railing against top brass - Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery. He also becomes involved in a love affair with a 19-year-old girl.

Howevers, readers should note that it was written in 1961, when many typical Brazilian ingredients weren't available in the U.S. or elsewhere, and the author has made adaptations, without mentioning what the original ingredient was! Brazilian ingredients are more widely available now, and you can usually figure out what the proper authentic ingredient is, especially by comparing the recipes in this book to those in more recent cookbooks. One tip -- in most cases where the author calls for parsley, you should really use cilantro (coentro in Portuguese). It would be wonderful if the publisher would issue an updated version of the book with authentic ingredients substituted back into the recipes, but this is still VERY useful. In particular, the section on desserts is excellent, but there are many other wonderful recipes here."

The author, Moses Coit Tyler, explains his motivations in his Preface.This is a long-since, out-of-print book that is certainly very much worth your read. Be aware at the onset, however, that history from this period can be saccharine, sometimes to the point of outlandishness. You will be pleasantly impressed with the detail and insight in the early chapters and maybe nonplussed with the author's hyper-adoration in his latter chapters.This author has a point to prove - that being that Governor Patrick Henry is one of the MOST laudable of the Founders. Most 21st century readers are willing to accept their heros bearing the blemishes of humanity: in the 19th century, heros were apparently acceptable only in saintly perfection. Tyler is probably correct in his high esteem for Governor Henry; but, the historian who begins his research with a point to prove, often ends as an author who has sacrificed impartiality, leaving readers unsure of where facts begin and end, or how to refine fact from hyperbole.Much of the appeal of the book is viewing history from a different chronological perspective, but as good as it is...don't let this be your only biography of Henry. You will find a very appealing Patrick Henry with a less mawkish delivery in Thomas S. Kidd's:Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots.-----kindle edition-----Well done, given the analogue to digital transfer process and the editing that goes with it. Page numbers are awkwardly left within the text and while there is a Table of Contents - it does NOT transfer to the kindle's menu choices.

Lewis, teaches biblical messages through a dramatic and intriguing plot. It all begins in WWII when a mother sends her four children off to the country to live with a professor for safety. The children were very curious and often spent hours playing hide and go seek, which lead to them discovering many new rooms and parts of the mansion. One day the youngest girl, Lucy, hid in a coat wardrobe. She walked to the very back of the closet where she revealed a new land. It was snowing and right away she discovered an odd creature. Lucy eventually went back through the wardrobe and tried to explain her discoveries to her brothers and sisters but none of them believed her. Finally Lucy was given the opportunity to prove her tale and her siblings peter, Edmund and Susan followed. Once they all entered the land they were told by a creature named Tumnus that the queen would want to kill them if she ever found them. This is because they were human and threatened her power. The rest of the novel is a biblical parallel to basics tenants of Christianity. The good and evil were always at war and at one point the Lion was slain. He rose from the dead and was able to overthrow evil. This is directly related to what the bible teaches. I believe this a great story. At a young age it has a fascinating plot with magical creatures and a powerful ending. At a more mature age is has vast symbolism that still allows for an easy read, without lacking in complexity. I think the characters in the new land are remotely bizarre but I enjoyed that if left me wondering about their personality because it lacks the usual stereotypes that are often placed on everyday characters. I couldn't tell whether the character was sympathetic or an antagonistic until I kept reading. Overall I highly suggest reading this book. When the final page is read it will leave you thinking. It's a quick read with deep meaning."

Fiction is not my cup of tea, but if there is anyone who could give me a taste for it, C.S. Lewis would be the one. Several years ago I read Lewis' classic, Mere Christianity, and I have had a growing interest in reading his fictional piece, The Screwtape Letters. I decided to read roughly a chapter a night to my girls who have seen both the BBC and Disney versions of the movie. It was a little difficult for Grace, my four year old, to always follow the story, but Rose, my seven year old, enjoyed hearing about the secret land beyond the wardrobe. Upon completion of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, both Rose and Grace have expressed on one more than one occasion their disappointment that I am not continuing on with Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia, the second of seven books in The Chronicles of Narnia series.

HumpherysIn this marvelous book by C.S. Lewis, The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, the settings are the Professor's house and Narnia. Narnia is a magical land where animals can talk and an evil Witch who thinks she'sQueen made it forever winter but never Christmas.The main characters in this book are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. These four siblings along with Aslan, a great lion with great powers, work to help free Narnia from the oppressive Witch, who has ruled by fear for a long time.When Aslan gave himself up to die instead of Edmund to appease a deep magic he activated an even deeper magic which kept him alive. Aslan being alive and the Witch not knowing it made it so that he could un-freeze those that the Witch had turned to stone. Leading the people who were once frozen into battle, they gained the upper hand and defeated the Witch.My favorite part of the story is when the four children are crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The reason I like that part is that the Witch is dead and there isn't a care in the world and the children are happy. People should read this book because it is an action packed adventure and a great read.One person I think changed during the story is Edmund. The reason why I think Edmund changed is that at the beginning of the story he is spiteful. One example of his spitefulness is when he saw Narnia and said, ""I was just playing with Lucy nothing really happened."" But at the end of the story he is kind and good. An example of his goodness is when he breaks the Witch's wand."

When Lucy, during a game of hide and seek, finds a big wardrobe in an empty room, she decides to use it as her hiding place. To her big surprise she notices behind the fur coats at the back of the closet a spot of white snow. The world behind the wardrobe turns out to be the wonderfully strange world of Narnia. At first her friends do not believe what she has discovered, but it won't take long before the others are face to face with the faun, Mr. Tumnus, the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a real treat for anyone who likes simple, but not less exciting fantasy. The power behind this book is that it brings the story without too much need to moralize. There is certainly some moral lesson behind what is happening, certainly when considering the actions of Edmund, but it never reaches the level of the Victorian Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Of course this book dates from the 50's and is written in an era that differs much from Victorian times, still it strongly reverbs the explorative nature of those times. The colorful characters are brought to life in a dreamlike setting that is bursting of opportunities for the six sequels that will follow this book. The humor is omnipresent, but certainly is at its best when the narrator intervenes with his commentary. Again a wink to Victorian novels. If you want to be engulfed in a wonderful and not too complex world, then The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good start."

However, his argument is hindered by very sloppy editing.The book abounds with spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. Now, I find errors in many books, but usually only a handful in the entire work. Open this book to any page at random and you will find a half-dozen at least. It doesn't appear that even a cursory spell-check was performed. Even important terms like &quot;hobbit&quot; are misspelled, on the back cover, no less!Bold, italic, and underlined text are used idiosyncratically, rather than according to accepted editing practices. For example, titles of books, which should be in italics, are often bold instead (though sometimes they're bold and italic). Text the author wants to emphasize is sometimes bold, sometimes italics, sometimes bold and underlined, and sometimes bold, italics, and underlined.There are also grosser editing errors. There is at least one place (page xi) where an identical sentence is repeated a few lines down from its first occurrence.Furthermore, a book that makes such extensive reference to Greek terms should either transliterate them into Roman characters according to accepted practice or use Greek characters. Instead, this book often transliterates Greek words according to their appearance rather than their sound. For example, one sees gamma transliterated as &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;g&quot;, and nu as &quot;v&quot; instead of &quot;n&quot;. This is distracting to those who know some Greek, and misleading to those who don't.Depending on the reader, all this may go mostly unnoticed. For me, however, the effect was so irritating that I had to set the book aside. Perhaps I can attempt to finish it on another occasion."

I'm interested in making jewelry and other beaded items that include things like ""flowers, leaves, and vines"" so once I discovered that this book is about beading with thread and not with wire, I knew I needed to have a look at it. The book is a slim one with 44 all glossy pages. The instructions for the components are given using brief word descriptions along with black/white/gray diagrams. The diagrams are very neatly drawn using standard shapes, not handrawn squiggly lines. I think the entire book has a crisp, professional look. The photographs are stunning and delightful. It's not a long book, but it is densely filled with the instructions for these components. This is not a bead book that spends the first 20 pages telling you about different kinds of beads, beading needles and threads. Nope! The intro to the book is on the inside of the front cover, then there is a title page and a page for the Table of Contents, then 41 solid pages of instructions, diagrams and color photos, and on the inside of the back cover is a one-page ""Basic Techniques Reminder"" in case you forgot how to do basic brick stitch with slanted edges, basic tubular peyote, peyote rapid increase, peyote gradual increase, peyote advanced gradual increase, mixing bead sizes, random dot bleed blending technique or the two-needle peyote start. Yep, all that on one page! The book contains component instructions for ivy vine, diamond bell flower, heart flower, morning glory, weeping willow vine, textural applique, Aurora's rosettes, three tier peyote flower...and on and on and on. Projects pictured in color: branches with flowers and vines, necklace with bell flowers, netted necklaces with flowers, leaves, and vines; peyote covered jars with flowers, leaves, and vines; flowers on beds of beaded moss or bead-covered rocks; leafy cascades, rosette chokers....etc. It's a lovely book with beautiful examples of what you can create with the components, and instructions for recreating Barb's designs if you don't feel like making up your own. Hers are beautiful, but I will enjoy using the information about how to create the individual components to make my own designs. I think an intermediate to expert beader would be much more comfortable with following these instructions than would a beginner. But if you are a beginner who doesn't mind a challenge, someone who avoids beadwork books with ""simple"" or ""easy"" or ""quick"" in the title, this could be for you too.

Large sweeping statements that he derives from a lifetime thinking about certain subjects along with the ethos of the times, a movement that he is annoyed is being held back. And in writing as he speaks, Fromm tells of the need to accept a humanistic ethic that does not necessarily to reference a divine creator or some higher authority, but instead derives from the honor and torture of existence itself, only informed by the few scant laws we can derive from science and practice. Fromm echoes famous existentialist philosophers from the same era that noted that we must take responsibility for our actions in all matters, as the physical causal chain of events leads in life as in biology or physics to a conclusion we either can live with or one with which we cannot. He is passionate in his writing and steeped in the deepest philosophy of the time for his discussion.I found the book to be a little too general, though it touches on matters of great importance. As well, most of the book covers the central idea of promoting a humanistic ethic and really doesn't define in enough detail what exactly that would mean, in practical terms, in everyday life. It, of course, promotes the idea of accountability and gives credence to the great possibility of science and study in informing our behavior, much as the positivists were famed for, but these ideas are often so general that they become little more than words in the nitty gritty of everyday interaction.in addition, I found it a little untenable how Fromm continually throws out claims after claim with nothing other than his own enlightenment and background teaching as the source of these ""truths."" Not that he's wrong. I think he makes a strong case, but it does often seem like he's just ranting. And since this book's publication there have been a lot of rather obvious questions put to this style of philosophy that were available at the time that Fromm simply glosses over with rather strawmen versions of the counters.That being said, I largely agree with much of what he says, I just think it needs fine tuning and a bit more cooperation with others in developing an idea and helping to frame his issues and work in terms of, not just his issues and work, but a larger part of discussions on a series of topics by wide variety of voices. And at his best, Fromm can make you feel like the emerging scientific revolution and all of its scary ethical questions that were becoming more and more important at the time her wrote the book."

Carlson,16/22,4.0,1057968000,A fine example of optimism,"In this book the author gives an overview of his thinking on humanistic ethics, which is interesting from a speculative/philosophical viewpoint, but falls somewhat short if viewed from a scientific perspective. The book has an optimistic tone, as do many others by the author, and this makes the reading more palatable. If the ideas in it could be fleshed out with real scientific analysis, with supporting data, it would be a significant advance in the study of human psychology.The author explains his optimism, interestingly, by reference to his experience with patients in his psychoanalytic practice. He speaks of encountering the strength of the strivings for happiness and health exhibited by his patients, which he believes is the natural embodiment of humans. &quot;There is less reason&quot;, he says, &quot;to be puzzled by the fact that there are so many neurotic people than by the phenomenon that most people are relatively healthy in spite of the many adverse influences they are exposed to&quot;. The statistics supporting this are overwhelming, and without a doubt are on the side of optimism.The book is not a &quot;pop-psychology&quot;, &quot;self-help&quot; book though, but instead a theoretical attempt to shed light on the problem of ethics and psychology. The author's goal is to get the reader to ask questions, and not to expect to find advice on how to obtain &quot;happiness&quot;. The author's main goal is to find a validation for humanistic ethics that does not collapse into moral relativism but is based upon human nature and human's inherent qualities. The character structure of the mature and &quot;integrated personality&quot; is the origin of virtue, and vice originates from the ignoring of the self and &quot;self-mutilation&quot;. To have confidence in values, the author argues, one must know oneself and be aware of one's capacity for doing good and being a productive human being.The author carefully distinguishes between humanistic and authoritarian ethics, with the ethical norms of the former originating from humans themselves, while the latter some other entity. It is important for him to clarify the definition of &quot;authority&quot;, one being &quot;rational&quot; authority, whose source is &quot;competence&quot;, and &quot;irrational&quot; authority, whose source is always power over people. Rational authority he says, is based on the equality of the authority and the subject, with both of them differing only in the skill level in their respective fields and always having mutual respect for each other. Irrational authority on the other hand is based inherently on inequality, and denies the human capacity to know what is good or bad.In humanistic ethics, as the author sees it, is formally based on the principle that only humans can determine the criteria for good and evil, and completely rejects any transcendent source of values. What is &quot;good&quot; is what is good for humans, and the &quot;bad&quot; is what acts to their detriment. Humanistic ethics, far from suppressing individuality and self-realization, encourages it, and there is no room in it for ethical doctrines that do not take into account the needs and nature of human beings. It is a life-affirming ethical philosophy, one that taps the human capacity for genius, and encourages responsibility for one's own existence. The crippling of human powers is the ultimate vice.The problem then for humanistic ethics is to find out exactly what humans do in fact need in order to develop a healthy psychology. Throughout the book, the author attempts to characterize what such a psychology would be. In many instances throughout the book he makes some unexpected commentary, if judged by the overall theme of optimism in the book. For example, he views the human capacity for reason as both a &quot;blessing&quot; and a &quot;curse&quot;. Viewing reason as a distinctly human capacity, not shared by other organisms (and this is troubling from the standpoint of current evidence to the contrary from biology), the author puts humans into a state of &quot;constant and unavoidable disequilibrium&quot;. No matter what the level of accomplishment, humans will always be discontented and perplexed, and consequently driven to find new solutions, resulting in an endless restless cycle of achievement and discontent. But many humans do not fit into his sweeping generalizations here, but instead are very contented with their lives on this planet, and find the challenge of life fascinating, and who mourn only the prospect of it ending.Because of his professional status as a psychoanalyst, it is not surprising perhaps to see a somewhat elaborate classification of what constitutes a healthy versus a non-healthy personality. There are &quot;receptive&quot;, &quot;exploitative&quot;, &quot;hoarding&quot;, and &quot;marketing&quot; characters, which are non-productive and signs of personality &quot;disorder&quot; in his view. He gives detailed descriptions of these different types, but unfortunately does not quote case studies or any studies in the literature to support his views. Do individuals who have these personalities find it difficult to live and adjust in soceity? The author would probably argue that such an &quot;adjustment&quot; could be done, but that by itself does not mean that the individual at hand is not following a healthy course of action. The author seems to be getting quite dogmatic in his classifications here, and leaves the reader with a somewhat narrow view of what constitutes a truly healthy personality.With more scientific research and justification put into his ideas, the author could have given the reader a more accurate view of what constitutes a healthy, integrated personality. The book is a good start though, philosophically speaking. Sometimes philosophy can encourage further scientific research, and sometimes it can clarify the issues involved in such research, but it can never take the place of science. The author's optimistic view of human nature is, to repeat, totally justified from a statistical point of view. And his view is somewhat rare, surprisingly, if one examines the statistics: the vast majority of humans are healthy, productive, and proud of their inner capacity for genius, and are without doubt fine examples of the humanistic ethic."

The fourth time, I noticed little clues that add up to additional facts and conclusions for which Owen did NOT make a declarative statement, yet the conclusions are inescapable. For example, why Hound left, how he felt about Jake, and what Tor was doing after Jake saw him the night of the devastating dance and the following morning.I bought this book both because I expected ""Brokeback Mountain with a happy ending"" (it is) and because I expected some light romance with maybe a dash of fun sex. It grossly exceeded my expectations. First, excellent, scorchingly hot sex scenes (including a foursome that I've reread dozens of times and that leaves me panting each time). Second, a favorite fantasy: hot, sexy, sweaty cowboys getting it on, falling in love and growing together, building an admirable romantic partnership. But then it exceeded my expectations by a mile by raising some serious issues, both between the two cowboys and between them as a pair and the outside world (e.g., families, bashing, jail, etc., which they conquered together, for the most part) and some serious conflict issues between the two of them: jealousy, infidelity, power (within their relationship and outside it), lost love, prison, dreams, etc. The book is well worth the read for the plot line alone. The ending was realistic and satisfying, and the characters for the most part interesting. Some of the scenes are overwhelming. Overall, one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time, and I expect to read it many more times before I tire of it."

I like the long length (of the book) but I found myself skimming the erotic sequences more and more as I read.On a plotting note, it worked well and painted a lovely picture. However, the romantic foil committed an act infidelity so vulgar (by this book's standards at least) that it was hard to believe the romantic protagonist would suddenly just change his mind. The author probably should have let their characters off the hook a little and spent a little more time crafting a more satisfying conclusion."

HOT, steamy, and Erotic sex that can only be described with the story of two men.Then Kennedy turned it around, into a slow but rest assured sweet romance between two lovers.The last part just punched me in the gut. I broke apart and I literally felt the agony Jake has gone through for days when he caught Tor with someone else. (I developed a slight discomfort whenever I hear the name ""Travis"")It was a great read but I believe a key to a great story is captivating the readers from beginning to end.Kennedy just lost me in the end. It was beautifully written but the trust he established with me was just ripped and torn apart. It's like giving someone a crisp piece of paper and asking them to crumple it up, only to ask them if they can return it the way it used to be. You can't.It's been almost a year and I kept it hidden somewhere in my stash of novels.I know this embraces the reality of the world, that no one can keep it in their pants too long before letting loose.But this is a work of fiction(I hope it is or I'll hunt Travis down) and the love story that contradicts the world today keeps me at bay(I mean who wants to read a part in the novel that we grew to know and get used to today?) this just goes to all the M/M romance novels I've read but Kennedy just ripped my heart out and returned it without mending the wounds.

I have to admit I almost gave up on it about halfway through - I don't regret finishing it, but it left me scratching my head at the end. It was a book in search of a genre, and after all was said and done, I still wasn't sure if I was reading M/M romance or M/M erotica, depending on which half of the book I was on.""Bareback"" starts out reading like unadulterated porn. Sex scene after sex scene after sex scene. A long orgy section in the middle somewhere, and I was wondering whether there would be a plot at some point. Don't get me wrong - I love sex scenes - but this was just overkill. Even when the plot does finally get moving about halfway through, there was still WAY too much sex for my taste - I skimmed at least 6 or 7 scenes (really probably a lot more!) and found myself thinking ""been there, done that."" To begin with, at least, the sex scenes are hot - and it's probably not that the others aren't hot, too, it's just that I was bored reading about sex after a while. On to the plot, then, which had its moments...MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW:Jake is the foreman of a ranch and manages a number of other wranglers. The fireworks fly almost immediately between him and Tornado (""Tor"" for short), a very competent but strong-willed hand who Jake also finds incredibly sexy (once he admits it to himself). The two men end up fighting (fists and all) and then having sex in the mud and pouring rain. Hot, definitely. Loved that scene. Eventually, they agree to be sex buddies. Tons more sex ensues, including a pretty hot foursome in a creek bed with two other cowboys.After a while, Jake and Tor grow to have deeper feelings for each other, and, with a little pressure from some of the other characters, end up sharing a room in the house the ranch hands live in. They begin to reveal to each other their personal stories, share some of their pain, and eventually realize they love each other. I had to laugh at the ""rings"" they exchange to acknowledge that love (I won't spoil that one!).There are the usual ups and downs, especially when they are forced to come out of the closet and both men end up in fights with the small-minded bigots in town. But mostly, they are happy together, even if they haven't quite figured out what it takes to make a relationship work.Trouble in paradise arrives a few years later in the form of a new ranch hand. Jake and Tor have been having a lot of fights, and their relationship explodes when Jake discovers Tor having sex with the new hand. Jake is devastated, and, in spite of Tor's apologies and guilt, the two men part ways.Yes, there is a HEA here. And I have to admit that Tor's cheating and Jake's reaction made for a pretty engaging 1/3 of the book. For that, I'm giving it 3 stars. But, overall, I was just confused. I understand that at the beginning, Jake and Tor's relationship is really based upon sex and that it isn't until later on that they realize they both need more. I got that. But did we need SO much sex? I think, with some sharp editing (as in cutting a lot out of the book, especially at the beginning to bring out the plot), this could have been more like a 4-star read. But as it stands, I probably skimmed about 1/4 of the book.So, if you like lots (and I mean LOTS) of cowboy sex without much plot, this is for you. If you want more plot-driven stories about sexy cowboys, I suggest you might want to readNowhere Ranchby Heidi Cullinan (hot/kinky sex, but sweet love story),Dark Horseby Kate Sherwood (first of series, menage but beautifully written), or Amy Lane'sKeeping Promise Rock(first of the ""Promises"" series, which is smartly written and damn sexy as well)."

The first 3/4 of the book deals with the topic of the Zeta Reticuli people, or a species of &quot;little grey men&quot; to most people.The latter 1/4 of the book deals with the prediction of a coming doomsday in may 2003. A pole shift which will cause natural disasters so immense that the world will be put back a hundred years.Needless to say, I was quite disturbed to read this. I immediately started researching the topic of the coming pole shift on the internet, emailed some top level scientists and UFOlogists asking thier opinion. For the purpose of relevance in reviewing this book, I cannot name them, but they are well respected, well known people.In addition to my own debunking and correlating the various viewpoints and mathematical hypothesis, I conclude that the claim of the pole shift, as outlined in the climax of this book, Zetatalk, is complete bunk. There are no facts to support that, or any of the other information in this book as being real.This is a book written by someone who claims to have been abducted by aliens. And she may well have been. I am actually an UFO enthusiast, but the mathematical claims that this book makes do not hold up... and there is no facts or proof whatsoever to substantiate any of the written material in this book.I conclude:* Read this book if you for some reason WANT to be freaked out by a doomsday prediction.* Read this book if you HAVE in fact been abducted by aliens, mabey you can learn something about your abductors.

All of the author's bizarre theories are easily debunked, and she seems unaware of even the most basic physics (not to mention the evident mathematical failings of an alleged ""computer professional""). Indeed, scientific principles are grossly misrepresented from start to finish, either from ignorance or by design.Her ""facts"" are also either incorrect or are interpreted in a facile and incompetent way. For instance, she asserts that the corals off Norway ""prove"" that it was recently in tropical zones. Actually, those corals (Lophelia) cannot survive in water warmer than 10 C or colder than 4 C, and are found below 200 metres depth off Norway, with some living colonies more than 7000 years old, and many older but deceased colonies at similar depths (they obtain nutrients in part from hydrocarbon seeps, which individually last only for centuries to millenia). They also occur in somewhat deeper waters in temperate zones, such as off Ireland. Lophelia even thrives in the tropics, but only at depths of 600-1400 metres, where the temperature range is suitable. So, rather than supporting her stupid theory about *physical* pole shifts or large crust movements every 3000 years, the distribution of these corals emphatically contradicts it. So does all the other evidence, but the author does not look for it or conveniently ignores or misrepresents it.Updated ravings and commercial pitches for her paraphernalia are available on the author's web site, which conveniently ignores the fact that her predictions in 1996-1997 were utterly false. She thought comet Hale-Bopp was a supernova, which NASA was covering up(?!?!), and that some planet-X brown dwarf would arrive in the Solar System in 1998. Due to its repeated non-arrival, her infallible projected arrival date has now been revised to May 2003, but it will be visible to the naked eye in late 2001 - no, no, mid 2002 with a big telescope - um, make that late 2002 with a long exposure CCD image using the big telescope. To support her fantasy and its repeated revisions, she has concocted the most amusingly absurd replacement theories for almost everything in human science. Of course, her theories are contradicted by even the simplest experiments and observations."

Ha-ha --- and later, it was even called ""swamp gas"". Well, the book called ZETA TALK, by Nancy Lieder is a big help to understand it all. Zetatalk (the URL) was initially some 15 chapters, with many many hyperlinks in each, so it represents an awful lot of valuable information that everyone on earth should know about. I highly recommend you read it soon!"

I personally hope that anyone actually seeking the truth will see through these sleezy tactics and buy this book. It is the best source of REAL information that you could get anywhere!

1893183157,Zeta Talk: Direct Answers from the Zeta Reticuli People,10.72,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,Marc Cabir Davis,10/16,2.0,1061510400,Unbelievable for totally different reasons,"Alright, its August 2003. This book is entirely based upon the assumption that in May 2003, there will be a pole shift on Earth that destabilizes the entire globe resulting in continents being moved all over the oceans, with massive lost to human life in the tens of millions. Obviously this hasn't happened yet, even though the recent war in Iraq was undoubtedly a bigoted conspiracy that also resulted in the loss of human life. Either way, this book is no longer relevant because its basis has now conclusively been proven as non-existent.This book is a 'guide to human life', written by a human who is supposedly channelling words and thoughts from alien beings in the Zeta Reticuli spectrum. A fascinating idea to begin with, but its tone is consistent throughout the numerous chapters in this book. We are introduced to how the human race actually began, and also prophecies for the future. The entire concept fascinated me as I'd always wanted to explore the supernatural as it were, plus I'm convinced I've seen UFOs in the sky when I was a child. Considering I haven't seen them in the last fifteen years should tell me something, but I was willing to side with the unknown for once, which is why I picked this book up at full retail from the UFO research center in Roswell, New Mexico (how appropriate!)Either the author of this book needs therapy, or shes partially telling us a little of what is really going on. That was the impression I got when I started reading it as the first few chapters are just so engrossing and involving. The main achievement here is the way the book is written. There is no hypothesis or guesswork here; everything is stated as if it were fact. This approach by the author leads to the entire book feeling like a Bible for the paranormally uninitiated, which is why the word 'hoax' has been thrown around so loosely regarding this enterprise.To be fair, if Nancy is indeed in contact with these aliens from Zeta Reticuli, then they do provide us with some interesting snippets of advice. But about a third through the book, the aliens start speaking to us as some sort of benevolent mother figure telling us to drink our orange juice and make our beds. This shift in tone was highly unsettling and even comical to me, especially considering the effort the author had put into the first few chapters to sound 'real'. In any case, her ideas on race and human evolution are simply astonishing as she debunks all popular theory in favor of her 'alien-hybrid' checklist. This makes for very interesting reading, but in the end its no different from the other thousands of books sitting out there.I particularly took offense to some of the wishy-washy conspiracy theories that the author throws around. Her staunch belief that JFK was killed because he was about to tell the public the truth about Roswell, is ludicrous. Her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe as some sort of immoral manhunter is not appropriate considering the content of this book, and her belief that Marilyn was 'killed off because of her big mouth' is just shocking. When a book states that Marilyn Monroe was assassinated because she had begun blabbing to her new male friends about the secret existence of aliens in government labs, you just cannot take it seriously anymore. Whats more, the author goes on to say that JFK Jr and Carolyn Bissette's plane crash was also orchestrated by the same people who took 'care' of his father, presumably because JFK Jr was about to tell the public about the existence of these aliens as well. Unbelievable.This is a total waste of money if you're interested in fact. But if you're interested in a good fictional read, I'd really recommend it. The author is undoubtedly schizophrenic and bipolar - she is at once well written and prosaic, and at the next moment unintelligible and nonsensical. This is the about the only 'pole shift' that is visible here."

They are in direct confrontation with the Guardian Alliance of the Elohim, Arcturians, Pleiadians, and other beneficent entities devoted to helping mankind usher in the New Age. It is true there will be much upheaval and chaos but the Zetas want to capitalize on your fear (and our governments) to ultimately use it to destroy us.If this material doesn't resonate (truly feel right) with you then try Barbara Marciniak's series of teachings from the Pleiadians and Patricia Pereira's Arcturian Star Chronicles. Then once you have a solid understanding of what's going on, move on to Operation Terra I &amp; II and Ashayana Deane's Voyagers I &amp; II.

However, it would take a complete imbecile to actually confuse any of the author's hallucinations with reality. All of the book's content was apparently dictated to her by &quot;inner voices&quot;. She should take her meds more regularly.She should also go back to high school, where she obviously flunked in physics. Most of her theories are contradicted by the most basic knowledge in science. She appears unaware of the properties of angular momentum (known 4 centuries ago), and simple Newtonian gravitation (known 3 centuries ago). She also fails to comprehend the scientific terms she does use. More recent scientific progress, such as in paleoclimatology and general relativity, is far beyond her ken.Drivel, even by the low standards of &quot;new age&quot; idiots who might be gullible enough to swallow interstellar telepathy as a communication medium.Incidentally, why is is that only the ignorant, the insane, or plain imbeciles claim to be contacted by the allegedly wise and advanced aliens?

In a problem play according to Tillyard speculative thought and the observation of human nature are not fully integrated into the action of the play, but rather have disproportionate space in the play in their own right. Problem plays too deal with characters on the verge of adulthood who must face difficult realities which lead them towards maturity. Tillyard argues that the Plays are not as gloomy as many might think. He also does not like the kind of criticism which makes simple links between some imagined crisis in the life of Shakespeare and the writing of the plays. He also stresses that the theme of 'mercy and forgiveness' is central in these plays most especially in 'Measure for Measure'.This is a thoughtful critical study."

Because of the large areas they cover the detail isn't very close-up so definitely not good for backcountry route finding if doing anything above class 1. If needing a map to navigate by when going cross country then get a USGS map which won't cover as much area but has much better detail. They do work well in conjuction with my gps if I stay on trail though which reduces the # of maps I have to take with me and less is always a good thing when it comes to my backpack weight. They are also waterproof which is pretty much a necessity in my opinion. Very happy with this purchase for what I use it for...trip planning.

The first was ""Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul,"" followed by ""Chicken Soup for the Cat and Dog Lover's Soul,"" and now finally, one that addresses my favorite creature of all, ""Chicken Soup for the Horse Lover's Soul."" If you are unfamiliar with the Chicken Soup books, they are collections of short (generally 2-5 pages), uplifting, and usually true stories submitted by readers. This particular volume contains 95 such tales, all pertaining to that magnificent animal, the horse. As a collection of short stories, the book can be read at whatever pace you like - an occasional dose here and there whenever you need a pick-me-up, or a consistent one or two stories per day, or even all at once.The book is divided into seven sections: ""A Special Bond"" shares tales of the deep and lasting friendships that can arise between horse and human. ""Horses as Teachers"" looks at the lessons we can learn from our equine friends. ""These Amazing Animals"" honors horses that have gone beyond the ordinary in a variety of ways, including the story of Sergeant Reckless, a little mare that served in the Korean War. ""Horses as Healers"" explores the ways in which equines have helped humans overcome all kinds of physical and emotional ills. ""On Companionship and Commitment"" is very similar to the first section and looks at horse-human bonds. ""And... They're Off!"" is dedicated entirely to stories of racehoreses. And finally, ""Horse... Cetera"" pulls together everything that doesn't quite fit anywhere else.Most horse lovers will find much to enjoy in this book. There are a few duds, and a few of the stories are overly corny or sappy, but the majority are truly heartwarming. Some will make you chuckle, like ""Battle of the Titans"" (pg. 381) and ""Trail Etiquette"" (pg. 388). Others will leave you with a wistful smile, like ""Confessions of a Horse-Show Father"" (pg. 394). And others will simply leave you feeling warm and happy, and appreciative of the good things in life, like ""A Job for Missy"" (pg. 157) and, one of my personal favorites, ""Ride the Yule Tide"" (pg. 291). Being an avid racing fan, I was delighted to see an entire section dedicated to racehorses. Included are accounts of well-known runners like Seabiscuit, Da Hoss, Funny Cide, and even the great race mule Black Ruby, as well as tales of more obscure horses who, nevertheless, have interesting stories to share.""Chicken Soup for the Horse Lover's Soul"" is almost a guaranteed winner for horse lovers. Some pieces are more entertaining than others, and the writing skills of the contributors varies (though the editors have ensured that all the stories are still very readable), but the overall effect is to bring together horse enthusiasts from all walks of life into a solid, well-rounded collection that will leave you smiling and fulfilled. I opted for the ""occasional dosage when needed"" method of reading, and each session evoked fond memories of the childhood years I spent around horses, and renewed my resolve to return to the world of riding as soon as I am able (currently a college student with limited funds). This would make a great treat for yourself, a gift for any horse-loving friend - or both!"

1588514234,"Israel, by Any Other Name",,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,William Hare,3/3,5.0,1034899200,The Current Middle East on Realistic Display,"Ghassan Ghraizi's Lebanese roots provide him with the perspective to hone a realistic novel about a fascinating but trouble strewn region as he examines the inherent political complexities of the Middle East while seeking alternatives to strife and violence. By using the framework of a novel in place of a non-fiction work of historical journalism he is able to carve a personal sketch of a fascinating, articulate young professional seeking the truth, aware of his past roots and realizing how they both enhance and impede that journey.Malek Adle is a public prosecutor in Beirut whose search for truth and meaning are enhanced by two events imploding at a critical juncture. The novel operates on twin tiers, as a mystery thriller in which the young prosecutor, working his first murder case, becomes involved in a turbulence of activity extending beyond Lebanon to Dallas,Texas, and on a second level as a love story. During this same pivotal period Malek in a poetry class meets Adinah Fink, a sensuous, beautiful Jewish woman with American roots.Ghraizi's plot spin reveals the truism that, as one looks outwardly for answers, such explorations ultimately turn the seeker inwardly. Such was the case with Malek, whose exploration for answers in his murder investigation leads him back to his own Arab roots and his intrinsic beliefs. The same holds true as his relationship with Adinah intensifies. A well educated man who was trained in the Christian religion but has become a no nonsense, pragmatic agnostic, Malek in time begins to consider the necessity for God, as well as to explore Arab-Jewish relations in new ways, constantly admiring both the unruffled candor and intellect of the beautiful Adinah. It is plain that Malek, a sober-minded man with a penchant for reading as well as a shared interest with Adinah in poetry, is enchanted with the Jewish woman as much for her keen intellect as he admires her compelling beauty.The two-tiered irony of Ghraizi's work is that he looks inwardly and finds answers concerning his own life through his dual pursuits of unlocking the mysteries behind a murder investigation and exploring fully his romantic relationship with the always fascinating Adinah. His life experiences dovetail to enhance his pursuit of truth as an Arab intellectual.This work is of vital significance today in that it reveals the thinking of a sensitive Arab intellectual seeking to come to grips with the complexities of the modern Middle East. What makes Malek such an interesting figure is that his beliefs are not embedded in cement. Malek Adle is willing to change his views, but only after a thorough investigation of the issues involved propel him in such a direction, a shrewd and determined pragmatist with an investigator's zeal."

It is pulp science fiction in a short novel format.
B0007ED4ZC,The sands of Mars,,A3E8QNDC7CV44,Paul Weiss,8/8,4.0,1148860800,A classic that stands the test of time!,"The Sands of Mars is a joy - a lightweight, easy-reading, far-sighted hard sci-fi novel that addresses the broad topics of interplanetary travel and colonization, development and terraforming of the hostile extra-terrestrial Martian environment. One could quibble, I suppose, that the science is slightly dated and there were certainly a couple of predictions that have since been proven incorrect but, for my money, the story is made all the more exciting and amazing for the degree to which it is now, fifty years later, approaching reality and the possibility of achievement!Martin Gibson, a celebrated science fiction writer, has been invited to be the first and only passenger on the maiden voyage of Ares, the first interplanetary vessel that will be devoted to passenger travel. A simple thesis indeed for a marvelous novel - Gibson's job is to report back to earth on the trip and his perceptions of the progress that the first colonists have made in their establishment of a flourishing base on Mars. Unlike Asimov's ""The Gods Themselves"" which addresses the philosophical and psychological impact of living in an alien environment on Earth's moon, The Sands of Mars restricts itself almost exclusively to addressing the hard core physical and scientific issues. Not to suggest that makes it less interesting or a weaker novel - that's just the side of the sci-fi coin that turned up when Clarke flipped it, I suppose! There certainly wasn't any shortage of topics - oxygen, air pressure, weather, heat, buildings, local travel (both on the planet and to Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos), interplanetary travel back and forth to Mars, emergency preparedness, government, effective utilization of limited manpower, biology and zoology (or at least Clarke's rather exciting vision of what is possible), communication and more!I also appreciated the fact that, while the science was straightforward and not particularly complex, neither was it dumbed down or patronizing. For example, when Ares first left Earth's orbits to begin the long trip to Mars, it was described as follows:"" ... she would pull away out of the orbit in which she was circling and had hitherto spent all her existence, to swing into the long hyperbola that led to Mars.""I haven't been a big fan of Arthur C Clarke's other more open-ended esoteric novels such as ""Against the Fall of Night"" but I certainly enjoyed this one!Paul Weiss"

It was an unusual read since Mr. Clarke had written the novel many years ago - when many assumptions at that time about the moon and planets have been proven false today. In fact, Mr. Clarke mentions that in the preface of my book - and asks the readers to see how many they can spot (like plants that grow on the Moon and Mars, to name a few). These distractions should not at all take away from the novel. It's actually a simple and straightforward story. A writer (of Science-Fiction), named Martin, decides to go to Mars - which is still in it's infancy of colonialism. The story then relates of the colony's attempts at maintaining the colony on Mars as well as their attempt at terraforming the planet. It's a good story, that many should enjoy!"

What it lacks sytlistically it makes up for in sheer joy of discovery and achievement by its characters on a Mars that was a valid extrapolation from knowledge at the time (c.1950) of writing. Good SF is about real people in a world that really might be - hence the personal secrets that are discovered along-side the planetary ones as the novel progresses.Mars officially is a cold, lifeless world, but the author Arthur Clarke has endorsed recent claims of life evidenced in space-probe photos. He might be mistaking hype for science, and geology for biology, but he might also have &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; in the back of his mind too."
B0007ED4ZC,The sands of Mars,,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,Bill R. Moore,4/5,4.0,976838400,Classic Clarke,"Although not one of his absolute best stories, The Sands of Mars is a classic work of science fiction and one which has held up well over time. It starts out a little slow at first, but once the story gets a bit into the Mars landing part of the book it increasingly picks up steam. Once again, in the climax of the book, Clarke has a seemingly impossible thing happen and describes it in such a way as to make it believable. Maybe that is the mark of a good science fiction writer. Also, the characters in this book, unlike some other works of Arthur's where the characters tend to be flat and somewhat dull, are quite believable and likable. Certainly you should read 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous With Rama, and Childhood's End first, but if you are an Arthur C. Clarke fan then you should definately pick up The Sands of Mars.On a sidenote, ignore the reviewer below who refers to this novel as &quot;Part of Clarke's one novel per planetary body pulp series&quot;. This is simply a ridicilous statement. First off, ACC DOES NOT have one novel per planetary body, and he, being of the leading and perhaps pioneering practicioners of hard SF, certainly does not write pulp. Indeed, if you read this book as part of the omnibus Prelude To Mars, you will read in the preface to Prelude To Space that that novel took Arthur 20 days to conceive and write, which is a record he has never since come close to equalling. Yeah, sounds like pulp to me. Sure. Forget the negative commentary and enjoy the book."
B0007ED4ZC,The sands of Mars,,AWLFVCT9128JV,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""",1/1,3.0,1247097600,Far From His Best,"Arthur C. Clarke's second novel, ""The Sands of Mars"", published in 1951, differs greatly from his first novel. Whereas ""Prelude to Space"" was focused on the technical details of space travel, Clarke puts much more effort into character development in ""The Sand of Mars"". That is not to say that Clarke ignores the technical as much as he did the character development in his first novel. He has some interesting discussions on creating livable conditions on Mars for man, and he floats an idea which he would return to in ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"".The story centers on Martin Gibson, a science fiction writer who has been invited to take a trip to Mars so that he can write about it. He is to ride aboard the Ares, which is a ship configured to start taking passengers to Mars. A fair amount of the story takes place on the Ares, as Gibson becomes acclimated to space and Clarke adds several incidents to the trip to keep the reader's interest while developing the characters. Clarke then plants the seeds for the big secret which Mars is keeping from Earth as Gibson arrives and is shown around the largest settlement.The reader becomes acquainted with Mars through the eyes of Gibson and the events which occur around him. Using these events Clarke builds the reader's expectations for the secret, and also throws a few curves into the story itself, some of which aren't all that believable. In the end, the secret is revealed and along the way the reader has met some interesting characters, but all in all it is not one of Clarke's better works. There are just too many coincidences both in terms of character surprises as well as storyline ones to make it very believable."
B0007ED4ZC,The sands of Mars,,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,"Andrew McCaffrey ""The Grumpy Young Man""",1/1,3.0,1238198400,The Lords of the Red Planet,"Arthur C. Clarke's THE SANDS OF MARS was written in 1951 and almost every aspect of the novel betrays the fact that over half a century has passed since its publication. What we now know about the fourth planet contradicts sharply with what's presented here. The pacing and style of the story are much like other science fiction writings of the period. And, indeed, the very attitude of the book feels very old-fashioned. But any potential reader shouldn't be scared off by the book's age. Clarke is one of ""Big Three"" of science fiction and his writing is strong enough here that something that would be regarded as a historical curiosity from another author still has a solid enough foundation to interest today's reader.We're told the story from the point of view of science fiction writer Martin Gibson who has been sent to a colony on Mars in order to better explain what life is like on this new world through written dispatches to the people back on Earth. The Mars colonies are still in their infancy; opinion on Earth is divided between those still excited about mankind's spread across the solar system and others who feel that Mars is simply an unnecessary drain on Earth's money and resources.Clarke spends far more on world-building and describing his future history than he does on advancing the plot, and the story-line itself never turns out to be anything likely to send the blood racing through one's veins. Indeed, it's one hundred and twenty pages into a two hundred and twelve page book before we get a hint at what the main conflict is. However, to look for an exciting, knuckle-whitening plot is to overlook the real purpose of the book. Clarke is much more interested in theorizing about how space travel will work, how a human colony on a hostile planet could exist and how humanity can flourish in the solar system.Having a science fiction author as the book's protagonist (and one who had an early novel titled MARTIAN DUST) allows Clarke to make quite a few meta-textual jokes about himself and his genre. At one point he is able to make a sly joke about the science fiction of the 1930s and 1940s by pointing out that ""today's"" more scientifically literate audience is able to accept the technical details for granted and to simply move quickly into the story. However, from my modern point of view this ""quicker"" novel still seemed very hung up on scientific explanations and slow to get to the plot (which is not a criticism, simply an observation of how science fiction was told at that time) .Of course, the other main difficulty to the modern reader will be the fact that very little was known about the red planet when Clarke put pen to paper and therefore many of his working assumptions turned out to be completely incorrect (no fault of Clarke's, of course). For me, the most difficult example of this was the descriptions of the terrain of the fictional Mars. My mind kept visualizing the landscape of Mars as it appears in the pictures we would later see from the Viking and Phoenix rovers. Then my mental image would be jolted by a throw-away mention of the thick, lush vegetation that the characters encountered on the surface. It was occasionally enough to jar me out of the flow of the story, which is a shame but not something that can be blamed on Clarke.Other things have changed since the early-1950s. I did a double take every time someone would pull out a cigarette and light up -- on a spaceship of all places. This is also a future where typewriters and fax machines are the technology of the day. And for old-fashioned attitudes, there are a number of vaguely disturbing (although faint) echoes of European colonialism in the book's concluding chapters.Still, it's probably bad form to criticize a book that's old simply for being old. The story may be slow moving, but it is fun and Clarke was at his best when spinning out all kinds of ideas for how scientific knowledge could be applied in practical ways. While it's not as challenging as some of Clarke's more focused pieces, it is a very interesting example of one of his earliest novels. This isn't the best place to start reading Arthur C. Clarke, but if you've enjoyed some of his other novels you'll find things to like here."

Oh, sure, there are a few anachronisms ~ vacuum tubes and the possibility of vegetation on Mars are the most obvious to my non-scientific mind ~ and we are not as close to having a colony there at the end of the Twentieth Century as Clarke expected, but almost nothing else is out of place. The plot itself is impeccable; Clarke has created likeable, fun, believable, cogent characters of whom it is a pleasure to read. Martin Gibson is a Terran writer journeying to Mars to report on the successes there; his discoveries, including the major one that life on a frontier is what he wants. Mars is on the cusp of starting to make itself independant of Earth by the success of a secret project that Warren Hadfield ~ Chief Executive ~ has had scientists working on: Nothing less, in fact, than the complete reformation of the planet is contemplated. There are surprises a-plenty and mountains of pleasure in this, Clarke's first great novel. It deserves more renown than it has."

B0007ED4ZC,The sands of Mars,,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,Roger J. Buffington,0/0,5.0,1248048000,A compelling story of human and personal destiny,"""The Sands of Mars"" is an underrated masterpiece by the master of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke. This is the story of the first human colonies on the planet Mars. In this story Clarke brilliantly weaves the personal saga of the story's protagonist against the panorama of Man's successful colonization of Mars. Clarke's speculations are dazzling, and as always, he weaves a touching personal story into a grander story of Mankind's expansion into the universe.There are, of course, the inevitable anachronisms in a story written more than 40 years ago. Clarke's protagonist uses a typewriter (typing on actual paper while in a spaceship) and they fax his manuscripts back to earth. Probably they used slide rules too.If some of Clarke's science in this novel is a bit out of step with what we now know (or think we know) about the planet Mars, it is not so far out as to detract from this story. This one has stood the test of time, and will not truly be dated until humanity has actually colonized Mars. In fact, ""The Sands of Mars"" accomplishes in a few hundred pages what Kim Stanley Robinsons' Red/Green/Blue Mars series never accomplishes in thousands of pages--Clarke creates a plausible and believable scenario for humanity's conquest of Mars, and tells an interesting story to boot. In Clarke's novel the people seem real, the science seems real, and the story moves along smartly at all times.The discerning reader will return to this novel more than once. Highly recommended."

Problem is it isn't as good as your expectations. Its main problem is Nick Ward, the author and illustrator, seemed to not be able to decide if his main character Sammy, should be a shark or a human. Picture books involving animals usually go one of two ways. The characters act like humans but instead of drawing people the illustrator picks an animal. Or they follow the real life animal's actual behaviours. Nick Ward tried to both and it doesn't really work. On the one hand Sammy is a shark, (albeit with some sort of disability where when he gets excited he chomps things with his mouth). But in most tasks he's living in a human world. Even his house is a human one complete with stairs, which of course would be useless to an animal without feet. Clearly the house is underwater yet they use a cardboard cereal box, have a calendar and other items that just wouldn't last in water. Their neighbourhood has roads, they even drive a car (a cool looking car I must admit) which are completely unnecessary when you can float up and down in water and as a shark would travel faster than the car would anyway. Not to mention in the school besides the obvious of his classmates being his food, you've got books and paper to paint on which again wouldn't be possible underwater.The book could simply have been so much better, if the school, house, neighbourhood etc had resembled the natural world, with underwater applicable versions of human school children activities."

B000PC6CT6,Life - As a Matter of Fat: The Emerging Science of Lipidomics (The Frontiers Collection),,ALGL6YLFBOR88,W. Chen,1/1,5.0,1268352000,A very interesting and readable book,"A panoramic overview of the current state of the scientific study of fats or lipids in living organisms (lipidomics), specifically lipid bilayers or membranes. It begins with the molecular structures and physical properties of various kinds of fatty acids (with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail). This unique property leads to the self-assembly of lipid bilayer in an aqueous environment which makes the emergence of the first cellular organisms on earth possible. The relative sizes and shapes of the heads and tails lead to different pressure profiles and thus the curvatures and shapes of the lipid bilayer. Temperature, pressure, drugs, invagination of protein, or mixing of different lipids alter the shape, strength and permeability of the lipid bilayer. All these intricate interplays enable the lipid bilayers to server as a protective boundary for the cells and vesicles, and yet allow nutrients, ions and other signal transmitters to be transported across the boundary, making the metabolic machinery of all living cells possible. The important roles lipid plays in lung, skin and brain are briefly covered, as well as an informative expounding of the properties and roles played by one of the most important lipid, cholesterol. The promising role lipid, particularly liposome, can play as a drug delivery vehicle and other nano-devices are also clearly explained. Overall, it is very readable book for laymen, except a small part that deal with membrane mechanics."

The early chapters are thorough and cover aspects of preop assessment, instruments, sutures, antibiotics etc. The mid chapters cover the flaps in detail for a dermatologist. There are then good chapters on cosmetic procedures. While laser surgery is changing all the time the principles are explained here, dermabraision has not changed. The chapters on sclerotherapy are good.Overall I would recommend this book for a resident with an interest in surgery or cosmetics. If you are not interested in doing a fellowship or specializing then this may be a bit much but your department should own one."

Besides, Castro took most of his book directly from this one.This story is also one of the finest studies of the dysfunction in an alcoholic family, with all the roles being lived out and understood by the participants.

A book that brings together the great minds of philosophical thought and their theologies in a cronologically ordered system. This is a great resource for those interested in this field. It logically brings together a history of thought from Plato to Satre and explores in a way that is not over the abilities of most college graduates. I recommend this book for those who want to put together these two disciplines in a historical context but not to the depth of reading all of the original authors. Some prior reading of the classic works in philosophy and theology is recommended in order to be able to fully utilize this resource.

This volume packs an amazing amount of material in its 280 pages, containing every big name in the history of philosophy. Yet this book is not simply a historical overview of the major tenets of the discipline; it is focused at every turn on showing how philosophy has impacted Christian thought. While Allen covers all one would expect from Plato and Artistotle to Hegel and Kant, he makes a deliberate effort to show how such leading Christian thinkers as Augustine and Aquinas interpreted and applied philosophy to their theology. This text is a superior introduction to the relationship between philosophy and theology. Highly recommended."

The authors do a good job in explaining the essential thinkers and the systems of thought over roughly a 2,500-year period.Beginning with Plato, the first inflection point, they briefly jump back to touch on the pre-Socratics, and then follow through with Aristotle and Aquinas, then the pre modern-, modern-, and post modern-ists.Although the authors are admirably objective in their narrative, there is a touch of Protestant bias (or is it my Catholic bias?) in the treatment of the Angelic Doctor. St. Thomas and Thomism is so much more than what the authors let on. Also, there always seems to be (in general with Protestant commentators) an attempt to ""lift"" St. Augustine out of the Catholic Church, primarily by placing Aquinas and Augustine in opposition. It is done here through the voice of Karl Barth speaking 700 years in the future. I've always felt this Aquinas-Augustine tension to mirror the tension found among the Gospels; i.e., the points of contradiction or non-agreement in the Gospels is additive to our Faith and helps us understand the great mysteries better, rather than nullifying either of them. I say all this with the complete confidence that the authors have forgotten more about Theology and Philosophy than I'll ever know - this is just my un-learned opinion.This work is composed so that each chapter can more or less stand on its own, so there is a bit of re-hashing and overlap - but I think that is a plus as it can be used to reference a single period without having to re-read previous chapters.All in all, a worthwhile and informative read."

The authors are doubtless brilliant but often repeat themselves again and again (note especially the section on Plato). Now, in their defense, I probably needed to hear Plato's basic tenets repeated many times over in order to get them, but I fear the average reader will grow frustrated by all the redundancy. Further, at times, it seems as though the author rambles in a sort of stream of consciousness manner without really holding himself to an outline. If I'm wrong, perhaps section headings within the chapters would be a good addition for a future edition."

According to the Bible, God created heavens and the earth. He is eternal, not that which he created. Allen explains that this differs from Aristotle who believed the universe had no beginning. The exalted One for Aristotle, then, is no different than the world. The difference then between the Christian faith and Aristotle (and philosophical systems that posit the eternality of matter) is ontological and epistemological.That's just the first page of Allen, and in it he previews the conflict that has existed throughout the ages between theology and philosophy.

Allen, Philosophy for Understanding Theology, iii)Faith & Understanding:Faith in search of understanding, therefore, writes Jaroslav Pelikan, had the duty of clarifying these various senses in which words were used. He quotes Maximos Confessor, ""To say something without first distinguishing the meanings of what is said ... and to obscure instead of clarifying. ... but one had to be careful to note the distinctive meaning acquired by such philosophical terms that were employed for Christian doctrine."" The Christian Tradition IITheology's Languages:""Philosophy and theology enjoy a peculiarly intimate relationship because they have been traditionally concerned with many common issues: ..., Such familiarity breeds territorial disputes ..."" Harriet Baber, Professor of PhilosophyRecently, the 'Joint Commission of the Theological Dialogue' between the Eastern and the Oriental Orthodox Churches', has stated after fifteen centuries that, ""On the essence of the Christological dogma, we found ourselves in full agreement! Through the different terminologies used by each side, we saw the same truth expressed!"" This is a very good example for why eminent Professor Diogene Allen was to explain in his book, ""How Philosophy Shapes Theology,'"" as proposed by Frederick Sontag years earlier. But did the eminent Princeton philosophy professor provide what he promised, in his book title, to clarify Christian dogma utilizing the tools of then prevailing philosophic systems?Issues for Clarification:The elaborate book neglected to underline that Christianity, a Hebrew Messianic hope was written in Koine, archaic Greek language, expressed by the Church fathers in Neo platonic and Aristotelian terms and expressions. Christian Theology was established by the great Alexandrine Church teacher Origen, whose De Principii is to this day the World View basis of theology, studied by Church Fathers allover the Mid Orient. They debated the basic Christian Doctrines in Neoplatonic terms of Alexandria counter the Aristotelian language of Antioc. Neoplatonism (reformed Middle Platonism) was in fact an Egyptian reformation of the archaic Greek philosophy launched by Amon Saccha and his school in second century Christian Alexandria. Augustine is a good example, converted from Manichaenism to Neoplatonism on reading Victorinus, Origen's student, before becoming a Christian. St. Augustine's view on Free Will was not philosophically defended and on Predestination were not properly verified biblically. These are few examples of the book's failure to tell the full story, as W. Kaufmann warned three decades earlier, ""It is easy to underestimate the originality of St. Thomas because he seems to synthesize Scripture and Aristotle, making ample use of all the labors of his predecessors, stating, ""St. Thomas made Aristotle say so many things he never said."" Critique of Religion & Philosophy, pp.144Theological Philosophy:""To treat the nominalism of the fourteenth century in a chapter ... may seem strange,"" is what the crafty author wrote, pp.151, and he is right. He quotes the eminent historian H. Butterfield for an assessment of the scientific revolution. Butterfield who though started logically with the historical importance of Philoponus' Impetus Theory, as the breakthrough point in the obsolete body of Aristotelian physics, he failed to identify Philoponus, who effectively deconstructed Aristotle's philosophy into rubble in sixth century Alexandria. It was known when this book was written, that Aquinas used John Philoponus philosophic writings, articulating Orthodox doctrines, of 'Creation ex Nihilo,' and the 'Resurrection.'Theology & Postmodern Philosophy:The well written second part of his book, is too condensed to be of good help to the lay reader who looks for modern philosophy to understand the Postmodern theological currents of the day. Recent strides in physics and developments in philosophy have superseded some of the scientific and philosophical concepts that were foundational for the modern world view. So, in a most explicit statement on the end of the modern era, in a critical evaluation of William James', Whitehead infers as the denial of any difference in its essence from the core and milieu of the physical, starting a new chapter in philosophy.Epilogue to a review:This book and its companion anthology of basic readings have been the textbooks for a Princeton Theological Seminary course that has been popular with its students. The books have also been also selected by other seminaries across the country. Church history and History of Christian thought are rendered more accessible to the readers of this book.This good introduction falls short to its intended scope of clarifying early fierce debates of the basic Christian Doctrines. While the first part missed explaining such concepts, the second part of the book is well crafted but is too concise, and not as thorough as others; (Colin Brown's 'Philosophy & The Christian Faith) and could hardly be recommended to serve as introduction to Malcolm Diamond's Contemporary Philosophy and Religious Thought. An alternative of the suggested reading list is ""Walter Kaufmann's Critique of Religion and Philosophy.""Aristotle East and West: Metaphysics and the Division of Christendom"

But Mr. Stater goes beyond the legal intricacies by throwing in a wealth of rich social and anecedotal material about a period in British history that has always seemed a bit tame -- the later years of the Stuart dynasty. With merry Charles II gone, and his Catholic brother James II forced off the throne, the late 17th and early 18th century Britons were ruled by the rather dull William and Mary, and then Mary's unfortunate sister Anne (who bore over a dozen children, only one of whom survived, and that one, a severally handicapped child, died at 11). Mr. Stater makes this era come alive through the framework of the contentiousness of the Earl of Mohun and the Duke of Hamilton, both striving for political power, both intriguers and both dead set on paying for their political ambitions with a disputed inheritence. All in all, a lively look at the period with a wealth of juicy details. But the foremost lesson to be learned here is that, whether it be 1700 or 2000, politics is still a game reserved for the very wealthy."

Using the conflict between Baron Mohun and Duke Hamilton as a base, the author explores the changing nature of the aristocratic lifestyle and the British social stucture. The political infighting between Tories and Whigs in the larger international context was particularly fascinating. While the narrative flow is generally solid, I was lost for a bit in the second chapter that covers the history of a property at the center of the feud. In addition, the numerous names an aristocrat could use made for some confusion. That being said, the book is overall readable and quite entertaining."

It concerns the adventures of a group of mystery archeologists who go round the world uncovering the hidden bits that keep our world a strange place to be in, the way it SHOULD be. These bits take on the shapes of major comics culture touchstones embedded in the conciousness of die-hard fans (Monster Island, Superheroes, Sherlock Holmes, Doc Savage) but with that arcane twist that has made Ellis a great postmodern comics writer (anothe great title is GLOBAL FREQUENCY--ever wonder what the $6 Million Dollar Man would REALLY be like? Take a look, if you dare.)The team, made up of: Elijah Snow, born at the turn of the 20th century, has the power to generate cold, cranky as all get-out and the founder of the Planetary Agency; Jakita Wagner, an orphan who hates to be bored and is as powerful as she is beautiful; and the Drummer, who can communicate with any and all mechanical devices with the help of his drumsticks, all roam the world, looking for the aforementioned ""artifacts"", but also trying to stop those that would with hold those wonders from the rest of us (ever wonder what the Fantastic Four would really be like--once again, look, if you dare).CROSSING WORLDS takes the reader on a wild ride through adjacent realities where the Planetary team encounter--in order--The Authority (one of PLANETARY's sister team magazines in the WILDSTORM line), a version of the JUSTICE LEAGUE (of DC COMICS fame) and, last but not least, BATMAN (no other intro needed).Ellis handles the writing chores, while Phil Jimenez (THE INVISIBLES, OTHERWORLD, INFINITE CRISIS) does the artwork on the Authority tale, Jerry Ordway(ALL-STAR SQUADRON, POWER OF SHAZAM) delineates the JLA tale and JOHN CASSADAY (CAPTAIN AMERICA, ASTONISHING X-MEN) brings his unique vision to BATMAN: NIGHT ON EARTH--the best of the three. The Authority tale gives a glimpse of the premiere team of the WILDSTORM universe and the JLA spin unfortunately falls short of what could have been a suspensful tale of what could happen if the Planetary team followed the path of the Four, trying to keep Humanity dull and boring.BATMAN: NIGHT ON EARTH follows Elijah, Jakita and the Drummer to Gotham City where a young man is committing impossible murders only to meet multiple iterations of the Dark Knight, with Cassaday bouncing through various representations of the character throughout his long history. A sight to behold and a great jumping on point for new readers.Other Planetary collections; AROUND THE WORLD; THE FOURTH MAN and LEAVING THE 20TH CENTURY gather the hard-to get early issues of this marvelous series.It's a strange world.Let's keep it that way."

Foong ""Long Suffering""",19/27,2.0,1126051200,Planetary: Crossing Worlds,"Planetary: Crossing Worlds is a woefully inconsistent collection of stories that feature crossovers with The Authority, JLA and Batman. There are three self contained stories presented here, and all fall short of anything we have seen in the ongoing Planetary series which is arguably the best work by writer Warren Ellis to date. In his regular series, Ellis manages to stimulate our imagination with over-the-top but fully realised ideas that are an exhilarating blend of pseudo-science and pulpy, nostalgic treasures of days gone by. In contrast, Planetary:Crossing Worlds feels incomplete. It lacks the cleverness and spectacle that has pushed this title's namesake into comic book greatness. Little if anything is added by way of character development and the disjointed story telling will put off all but the most hard core Ellis fans.In the first story (Planetary/Authority: Ruling the World) Phil Jimenez lends his detailed pencils to what should have been a classic encounter between Ellis's two best creations. Instead we are presented with an `alien fish' invasion story that fails to rise above mediocre. If you were anticipating interaction and dialogue between the two teams you will be sorely disappointed. There is a brief flashback `encounter' from 1939 between Elijah Snow and Jenny Sparks but little else is on offer by way of a `crossover.'The second story (Planetary/JLA: Terra Occulta) is even less satisfying and ends up a confusing mess. Featuring serviceable if unspectacular artwork by Jerry Ordway this story is set in an alternate Earth where an evil Planetary rule the world and the only ones that can stop them are Diana, Bruce and Clark. Little respect is shown for any of the characters here and the reader is given little reason to care for where this story takes us.The final tale is able to partly redeem this collection thanks mostly to the stunning pencils of John Cassaday. Planetary/Batman: Night on Earth takes Planetary to alternate Gotham realities where they meet numerous incarnations of the Bat. Both amusing and rewarding for those familiar with Batman over the past 20 or so years, we are finally treated to some great action and interplay expected of a crossover book. However as much fun as Ellis and Cassaday must have had putting this together, there is a sense of novelty here and nothing substantial to pick up on a second reading.All in all, Planetary: Crossing Worlds offers little to regular and casual comic book fans and is hard to recommend. The crossovers feel forced and Ellis fails to hit his stride. Perhaps if given more space to flesh out each story there could have been a better presentation, but it is doubtful there will be second chances for future comic books featuring these characters.(Also of note: this collection has 2 pages of miscellaneous sketches for Planetary/JLA but does not present the original comic book covers anywhere)"

For those scratching their heads, Planetary is a covert global entity, with offices located around the planet, dedicated to unearthing the world's secret history. Its primary investigative branch consists of three superhumans: the superstrong, super-resilient, suffers-no-fool-gladly Jakita Wagner; the century-old, temperature-manipulating, sort of elitist, Elijah North; and the perhaps insane master of machinery, the Drummer.PLANETARY: CROSSING WORLDS collects three Planetary one-shot stories stemming from the more-often-than-not innovative mind of Warren Ellis, these stories showcasing these ""Archaeologists of the Impossible"" in various team-ups, some clunkier than others. Phil Jimenez illustrates ""Ruling the World."" Jerry Ordway draws ""Terra Occulta."" John Cassaday provides the visuals for ""Night on Earth."" Jimenez and Ordway's efforts are workmanlike. Cassaday's stuff is stellar.""Ruling the World"" kicks off this trade, and it may leave you with tangled reactions. The Authority, as you know, is all about making big, splashy statements. The Planetary slinks in the shadows. So, naturally, the two teams' warring philosophies mandate the inevitable crossover story. Others may think this frustrating or a cop out, but I think it's actually pretty interesting that, even though the Authority and Planetary become peripherally aware of each other (with Planetary being more cognizant), the two parties never do make contact with each other. (Elijah and Jenny Sparks' eyebrow-raising encounter in 1939 doesn't count, does it?) The unifying element is a cache of alien eggs which, when activated by human contact, produces horrors on a Lovecraftian scale. The Authority, them metahuman busibodies, step in in grand fashion to save humanity. The Planetary trio, meanwhile, harbor doubts regarding the Authority's totalitarian approach and opt to sneak onboard the Bleedship that serves as the Authority's headquarters in hopes of stealing invaluable datafiles. Both teams separately spring into action. The world somehow doesn't end. It's an okay read, if you like narratives that end with a whimper.""Terra Occulta"" is unsatisfying on several levels. The primary nitpick is that this is not the Planetary that we know and love. In some alternate universe, a Planetary gone all sinister has taken over the world. It's left to three individuals - Bruce Wayne, Diana Prince, and Clark Kent - to work in concert to end the Planetary's reign of tyranny. The interesting thing about this story is that we get to see what's become of the potential members of the (non-existent) Justice League. For example, the panel featuring the Flash's gruesome fate is a bit disturbing. Maybe if this story had been longer, the writing would've allowed for more extensive characterization and more opportunity to go into further details. As it is, it all feels very busy and rushed. and what's up with the bald Elijah Snow? But I did like the death duel between Jakita and Diana. The bat costume that Bruce debuts sucks.""Night on Earth,"" gorgeously illustrated by John Cassaday, is the primary reason to get this trade. In a Gotham City that had never seen a Batman, Planetary tracks down a serial killer who can alter reality. As the killer activates his powers - of which, it turns out, he has no control - Planetary is exposed to a series of Batman incarnations. Ellis does a fantastic job of paying homage to 70 years' worth of the Batman. You get a sense of how his physical appearance and personality have evolved down the decades. Miller's huge and intimidating Dark Knight is very recognizable, as is Adam West's officious and doughy interpretation. We also get a peek at the Neal Adams' version and the mostly forgotten Bob Kane rendition. People tend to forget that, when he started out, Batman sported a gun. I love that Jakita gets hot and bothered by the first Batman (""Tell me you're single."") but then is quickly turned off when Adam West pops up."

Creaed almost at the same time as The Authority, Planetary is the second of the books that closed a decade and a century of superhero comics. While The Authority propelled them into the future, launching them into the realm of widescreen movie-like action, Planetary is a summa of what has been and could have been, the genre's swan song and a love sing to it and its many facets and authors.The three tales told here are not really mcuh more than a divrtissement, but if it truly is so, then we need more authors having this fun.The opener is actually the lightest and easiest, bringing The Authority and Planetary together to fight a common, ancient menace from the Bleed (the connecting tissue in which the multiple universes ""are"", in a way). Fun fact: The two teams team-up without actually meeting and eventually shutting up the bad guys. Aside from the Lovecraft quotes (and the funny cameo of the writer himself), the book pits two different visions of superheroism against each other, wonderng wha would happen if almighty heroes who took it upon themselves to put things right ever lost their unflinching moral compass.The second tale is what would have been an ""elseworlds"" tale in the Nineties: An alternative view of DC Comics' heroes. In this case, Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman nver were, because the Planetary foundation (their turn to go bad) turned from researchers to hoarders and control-freaks, killing all of the planet's heroes before they even started.But Bruce Wayne is alive and kicking and putting his detective skills to work: he has a&uacute;ncovered it all, found Krypton's only survivor and the last Amazon alive and brought them together to fight back finally.The last novella is Ellis & series's artist John Cassaday at their absolute best.Just like Grant Morrison ten years later, Ellis proves he understands the core concept of the Batman, what lies below the many iterations that many different artists and writers gave of him in his 70 years of history. Coming up with an intersting plot device (a kid able to teleport chunks of reality and connected information through multiple universes, made sick and a killer by his powers), Ellis uses it to explore the Batman mythos and Planetary looks almost like a witness to them. cassaday drwas the hell out of it, his art is so vital to this, so key to making the stroy work that noboy else could have done this book but him.One last note about the artists of the first two novellas: While I am not Ohil jimenez's number one fan, he does a great job in the first tale. However, I was absolutely amazed by what Ordway made of Warren Ellis's script. It is my guess that Ellis retained complete control of the book'sstorytelling, challenging Ordway (a very classic American artist) to go to darker places than he usually does, freeing him so that he could unleash his usually restrained artistic talents (the guy is also a writer) He channels the best George Perez here, absolutely a wonderful surprise!This collection is worth every penny and many, many readings.Enjoy!"

While loosely tied to the series' main arc, the stories are free of continuity. This is Ellis on vacation...but apparently he got bored and decided to doodle a Planetary script on his napkin in a bar somewhere. And now here I am writing a review. These stories are slack but fun; Planetary in kickback mode.The first story involves a run-in with the Authority. This story is all spectacle and bright lights, with a rather linear plot for Planetary, which is always twisty and underhanded. Pleasant, but a shiny diversion nonetheless; the only unexpected element is a ""cameo"" by H.P. Lovecraft. This is the least interesting story of the trio.The second story is a through-the-looking-glass reversal of roles: what if Planetary were an evil, big brother overlord that controlled humanity? Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman cook up a scheme to infiltrate their headquarters for one big showdown. Not a bad effort. It poses the question of what would happen if the Justice League were to fight Planetary on their own terms (can Superman outmaneuver Chase's reality distortion field?). As always, Batman, the man with no powers other than being human, is a masterclass strategist.The third story is my favorite. Though less dramatic than the previous story, it exploits a single, very clever premise: someone in Gotham City is phasing in and out of various realities, wreaking havoc on the environment; and as Planetary tries to seek out the culprit, various incarnations of Batman (who does not exist in the Gotham of this reality) phase in and out and becomes a nuisance to Jakita.All in all, I'd say this is worth a purchase if you're already familiar with Planetary and its main arc. This is a solid way to kill time, because Planetary is immune to being boring. They are at least interesting, which is what these stories are: interesting and worth musing over. Otherwise, this collection does not outclass what is already out there; and so if you're new, best to start from the beginning."

Out of all of my aformentioned examples, only Morrison has seem to snapped out of this juvenile behaviour (""Ooooohh, I'll have my hero vomit on Batman's boots, that'll be a larf and p1ss the fanboys off!"") and actually shown the medium some respect as in his JLA and now X-Men stints; second: why MUST all of their female characters be total shrews? Ellis is the most guilty of this as he does write strong female heroes but with their collecive personalities, I wouldn't let them lead a church choir, let alone a team of meta-humans; third, why, when they create their own heroes/worlds, do their hates and predjudices magnify even fiercer? Which brings me to Ellis: I tried to read The Authority as I was swayed by all the media hype (caused mostly by Entertainment Weekly) and it was the most vile piece of garbage I've read since Preacher: Ancient History (I'm sure the last would bring smiles to the respective authors faces, as they loooove to shake things up and see that look on your face), the homosexual relationship was the least of my issues as if it was seriously and tastefully done, it may have surpassed the ""Northstar""/""Alpha Flight"" issues, but noooooo, let's make them a violent, misanthropic, mincing parody of the Superman/Batman mythos--and if you want violent, misantropic, butch AND fascist, let's talk ""Jenny Sparks"" from that same title--AAAARRRGGHH! (deep breath) Anyway, it was with some trepidation that I picked up the first issues of the ""Planetary"" series and I was shocked to find I enjoyed MOST of it--oh you still have the ""Beyotch from Hell"" in the female hero role, the grumpy old man and last but not least the grunge rocker ""hero"" Seattle left behind and you still have the usual snotty pickings on our literary and historical lions (H.P.

B000GQ02BU,Let Love Come Last,,,,21/21,5.0,900028800,A must read for anyone who has children,"Taylor Caldwell has written a moving story of a quiet and wise woman who marries a man driven to power by his childhood agonies and poverty. Although the story takes place in 1879-1908, it is particularly poignant for parents today. He spoils his children by lavishing them with everything he has, and in so doing, as observed by his long suffering wife, he avenges his own childhood suffering at the hands of a world run by greed and the twisting of Christianity and capitalism into an unholy alliance. William Prescott never achieves the love of his children which he craves so intensely. Instead, his adopted and first son turns out to be the best of all. His wife constantly shields him from the slings and arrows of his children and herself leads a loveless life, because of his obsession with his children, and because he forgot that one should never put children before a loving spouse. This story is so relevant now where so many parents refuse to discipline their children in their own efforts to exorcise their own often overblown perceptions of an unhappy childhood. This book is really important for new parents to read. The profit they can realise from living with the Prescotts in this book is immense.This is one of Taylor Caldwell's most important books."

Tierney prefaces the main body of his material with a few short but fascinating passages from and on people like Ambrose and Augustine. In the following chapters, he traces the debate about the relationship between Church and State as it developed in three or four dozen key documents from 1050 to 1300. Tierney helpfully sets context for each passage. In some, popes and kings jockey for power; in others, thinkers offer balanced or didactically one-sided solutions.Again and again one notes key NT passages coming up, like &quot;My kingdom is not of this world,&quot; and &quot;Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.&quot; As Tierney notes, the influence of Christianity on the proceedings are clear in two ways: first, &quot;The very existence of two power structures competing for men's allegiance greatly enhanced the possibilities for human freedom.&quot; And second, &quot;The possibility of a continuing tension between church and state was inherent in th every beginnings of the Christian religion.&quot; The documents eloquently demonstrate these points for themselves. The interest is not always in big themes, however, but often in human and even humorous details. Tierney's selection is varied.Anyone who thinks modern freedom was an escape from Medieval despotism or ex nihilo invention of the Enlightenment, or that all religions are the same, and theological differences between religions have little practical effect, should carefully read this book. Clearly, the Grand Inquisitor is not the whole story, nor the big story, of the Middle Ages. Donald Treadgold's Freedom: A History, also makes some good comparative points in relation to other cultures. But there is nothing like going to the original sources for getting a feel for what people really thought, and why they thought it. An excellent resource."
B00005VQB9,"The crisis of church and state, 1050-1300 : with selected documents",,A3JNCOY4A3MJUG,"James E. Egolf ""James E. Egolf, MA""",19/20,5.0,1155168000,A Careful Examination of the Medieval Catholic Church vs. The Authority of the Secular Rulers,"Brian Tierney's THE CRISIS OF CHURCH AND STATE: 1050-1300 is an interesting study of the struggle between European secular rulers and the Catholic authroities for control of the ""Universal Church"" (the Catholic Church). This struggle was basically a poltical affair in which men on both sides added religious arguemtns to bolster their case. This is not to say that some of these men were not motivated by religion.Readers should realize that contemporary definitions of separation of church and state did not exist in the Middle Ages. There were divisions, but these were narrowly defined. However, due to these struggles the Catholic authorities were gradually able to free themselves from secular control which was the beginning of separation of church and state.Tierney begins this study with early Catholic sources definning the relationship between political authority and the status of Catholics. He cites St. Augustine's (346-420 AD) THE CITY OF GOD in which St. Augustine considers state authority as a necessary evil due to Man's sinful nature. Tierney's explanation and comments are clear and accurate.Tierney next examines the internal control of the Catholic Church. One should note that until the 11th. century (the years between 1001 to 1100) that men who controlled monestaries held considerable prestige and power. The fact is that land represented both wealth and power, and the monestaries had control of large land areas. One of the internal Catholic Church questions was that of reform and the relationship between the secular clergy and regular clergy. Abbots and monks were known as regular clergy because they followed a monasttic rule such as the Benedictine Rule for example.Another internal dispute that Tierney effectively explains is that of reform of both the secular and regular clergy. Catholic authorities have never concealed problems and scandals. The question was who should be in charge of such reform. The monks claimed this was their responsibility. Secular rulers claimed reform was their responsibility. The Popes and the Curia claimed this was their responsibility. Tierney adds that members of Church councils should take control which irritated the Popes and Curia who saw such councils as intruding on the authority of the Pope.However, the most significant conflict was the Investature Controversy between the German ruler Henry IV (1056-1106) and Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085). Tierney explains that in 1057, the Papal Curia initiated the Papal Election Decree to remove the German rulers and other secular rulers from imposing their own candidates to the Papacy. The Investature Controversy involed the authority of appointing bishops to their dioceses. Many of the German bishops had been appointed by the German rulers,and these bishops loyalty between secular rulers and the Church was at best questionable. Gregory VII tried to put an end to this problem by challenging Henry IV's authority on this issue. The results were turbulent and at times violent. There were exommunications, military campaings, the looting of Rome by the Normans, etc. One result was known at the Papal Revolution.These conflicts between Catholic authroities and the Germans ended with the reign of Frederick II (1211-1250). Readers should note and Tierney explains the Frederick II succeeded Frederick Barbaroosa (1152-1190). This conflict ruined the German Empire temporarity enganced the Papacy and status of the Catholic Church. Readers should examine Tierney's comments and the sources he cites to have a good grasp of these conflicts.Tierney also does a good job in explaining the bitter conflict between the French King Phillip (1285-1314) and Pople Boniface VIII (1294-1305) which inflicted an almost fatal blow to the Catholic Church. This section of the book is perhaps the best section. Tierney's use of sources and introductory remarks are very well done.Tierney also examines the Canon Law jurists and Scholastic philosophers. Of particular note is the thinking of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). St. Thomas showed a marked difference with St. Augustine. Aquinas' view of the political authority was to protect men and women rather than a necessary evil due to their sinful nature. In regards to the Canon Law, Aquinas argued that the Canon Law was to give each man his due. One can note the change here.This reviewer recommends this book.

Translated from Latin into fairly readable English, Tierney includes introductory material and notes which allow him to maintain some of the nuance of Latin connotations that would usually not carry over into English translation. This book has lots of documents that we all hear about in European History texts but usually don't read in their entirety, such as the supposed &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot; which the Renaissance linguist Lorenzo Valla proved to be a forgery through textual analysis. Tierney's book shows that far from the relatively aloof, spiritual province the Church consigns itself to today, things weren't always that way. In the medieval era, the Church Militant was every bit a secular authority as well as a spirtual one, and the boundaries between church and state blurred. It was only through the centuries of conflict reflected in Tierney's book that the modern split between church and state first emerged, and the possibility of Western Europe and the United States being ruled by theocratic governments faded. A great supplementary text or source of documents for a medieval history or western civilization course, this book would be an interesting read for anyone concerned about the ancient roots of the tension between Church and State whose reverberations still echo today on Capitol Hill."

However, I do not think that the reader can fully enjoy the entirity of the book without being apart of a discussion group or a class. This book is remarkable for its reference and outline. Tierney, being an anti-infallibist, helps guide the reader through his work by using the dialectic method. Arguments are presented and then the counter arguments are presented. This may seem repetitive but it is all apart of the process. This allows the reader to see one side of the argument get rebuked by the other side and then that side get rebuked again. In addition, each introduction to the chapter/section, provides all the background you need to know in order to enjoy the battle of wits, so to speak, between papal loyalists and emperor loyalists.As one other reviewer noted there is continuing recurrence of key passages from the Bible in this book. This is central to the main argument that is taking place. Of course the main argument is who controls what and who has the power over whom. Knowing a little of Tierney's background will help you understand his position, as an anti-infallibist, meaning he doesn't like the papacy, to put it bluntly. But don't take that to heart. Tierney along with many other especially the emperors of the medieval ages did not agree with the papacy. Back to the main argument. When reading this book make note of the key passages aforementioned. It seems that sometimes this is the only ammunition that the papacy has, basing their power on what Jesus said to Peter. Of course, any serious student of religious studies knows that the NT is made up of thousands of texts, most written about two generations after the death of Jesus and later, so it may be impossible to really imply that Jesus was really granting Peter supreme authority on the earth. For more information see various works on N.T. Wright, E.P Sanders, or Powell's book, Jesus as a Figure in History.Overall, this is a great book, which may seem dry at some times, but it is well worth the read."

Easy reading; after all, this isn't Shakespeare--and doesn't need to be. But while it doesn't offer any earth-shattering insights(I actually did know everything recited in it already and could quote the original sources without a bibliography handy, if asked), it does offer honest, accurate information, however simply stated it may be. There are some nice pictures of Jordan, mostly from his New Kids days, with a few newer ones. Personally, my favorite part was the listing of Jordan Knight websites given, with grades for each; and I was glad to see that my favorite(&quot;Jordan Knight: Since You Walked Into My Life&quot;, whose webmistress is Melissa C., a very friendly and knowledgeable young lady who deserves to be Jordan's personal assistant) got the props it deserved, an A+. I do recommend this book for fans who have followed Jordan since he was in New Kids and want a nice piece of solo memorabilia on him and to the newer fans who are just discovering why Jordan has enchanted so many of us for so long, who need some good basic information on him and how he's gotten to where he is today. The only book about Jordan that could be any better would be his autobiography--but he's a little young, yet, for that."

It's about time that someone did a bio on a real talented younger singer. This book did not talk down to the fans, it &quot;spoke&quot; to us in a mature way.

Being one of Jordan's older fans, I assumed the book would talk down to the reader, and use a lot of exciting buzz words to keep the new younger fans interested, as many others have in the past. To my surprise the book was a well written, comprehensive, and honest portrayal of the life and times of Jordan and NKOTB. I found that the book brouht back many nalstigic memories for me, and the pictures, especially the one on the cover, will get any red blooded girls heart racing. So, I do recomend picking up a copy for anyone who is interested in learning about Jordan's life, and any hard core block heads out there who have lived through the mania, and want to be reminded of the good old days."

In doing so, he missed a very simple back row mate.The edition I received was the Dover edition. It states that it has corrected typos and replaced faulty problems that existed in the previous editions. However they did not find them all, but this is to be expected.The book uses algebraic notation, but with the German ""S"" for Knight instead of the now standard ""N"".My purpose for purchasing this book was to understand a systemized process for solving chess problems instead of relying on intuition or brute force (running through every possibility) as I've been doing all my life.

Naturally, I added the book to my own collection. It really is a good old-fashioned mid-twentieth century horror story. The basis of the tale is rather standard fare: a young, obsessive doctor (Patrick Cory) insists on pushing the limits of human knowledge by attempting to keep a brain alive outside of a host body. A pretty, neglected wife watches and worries, and an older colleague consistently berates the young doctor for his all-consuming passion and preaches to him the dangers of playing God. After some limited success sustaining a monkey's brain, the doctor is presented with a golden opportunity to expand his work to the human brain itself. A plane crashes in the remote area of his private laboratory. He amputates the crushed legs of one survivor, but he knows the man will never live long enough to reach a hospital. Quickly, he seizes the opportunity so serendipitously handed to him by fate. In effect, he steals the brain of the man and coerces his reluctant colleague to help him cover up the act. It turns out that the victim is a man of great wealth and fame named Donovan.. The brain is placed in a vessel, its arteries supplied with blood by an artificial pump. Dr. Cory studies the brain, observes its cycles of sleep and wakefulness via electronic readings, and tries to communicate with it. In time, the brain not only communicates with Cory but comes to take control of his own body, seeing with his eyes, carrying out the dead man's former agenda. When the older doctor tries to destroy the brain, it compels Dr. Cory to attack him. The brain sends Cory to Los Angeles to carry out its orders, which includes freeing a murderer from prison, and Cory eventually becomes a prisoner in his own body, capable of watching the brain speak with his voice and move with his body. The physical brain grows larger and more powerful as Cory's reluctant colleague continues ""feeding"" it in the lab. Predictably, the book climaxes on a battle between the brain and Dr. Cory for permanent control of Cory's body.It sounds like standard B-movie sci-fi fare, but Siodmak's writing never allows the story to become a stereotypical, Saturday matinee-type adventure. While I did not find this book particularly horrifying, I did find it compelling and completely engrossing. As an interesting aside, this book would seem to supply the source of a particular tongue-twister used by Stephen King in his novel It. All in all, this is classic sci-fi/horror at its best and stands shoulders above most of the similar works written in the golden age of science fiction."

Curt Siodmak was a German screenwriter, director, and science fiction author. Some of Siodmak's other novels include _Skyport_ (1959), _Hauser's Memory_ (1968), and _City in the Sky_ (1974). _Hauser's Memory_ is a sequel of sorts to _Donovan's Brain_._Donovan's Brain_ has been made into a movie three times: as _The Lady and the Monster_ (1944), as _Donovan's Brain_ (1953), and as _Vengeance_ (1963). It was parodied in _The Man Wth Two Brains_ (1983). I would not be surprised to see yet another movie served up at some point. Does the original novel merit such attention?Well, no. Not really. The science is extremely simple-minded (as is the case in other Siodmak novels and screenplays). The plot is more 1930s _Amazing_ than 1940s _Astounding_, with the scientist in the white lab coat rearing back in horror from the test-tube monster. But it is a passable Gothic chiller. The story unfolds in a series of letters and journal notations written by various characters (shades of _Dracula_!). Donovan, a wealthy industrialist, is killed in a plane crash; but his brain is preserved by an enthusiastic scientist. Donovan's evil personality takes over the minds and bodies of others, forcing them to do his will with forgery, murder, and-- when their use is over-- suicide.It is to Siodmak's credit that he makes Donovan a genuinely menacing personality. The novel is better than I feared that it would be. But it is not a major piece of writing."

I tried using my school textbook, but its explanations of concepts were shoddy at best, and sometimes not related to anything on the AP test. I bought this book, and I can say with confidence that I would not have had a prayer on the AP test without it. In addition to providing invaluable test-taking strategies for both the multiple-choice and free-response sections, it goes over everything on the AP test, with special attention paid to the concepts that are most likely to appear on the exam. Its explanations are clear and concise, with numerous practice problems to help you make sure you've ""gotten"" a particular idea. The practice tests helped immensely, as well, and they were very realistic and quite similar to the real exam. One caveat: the book doesn't go over velocity and acceleration vectors, so make sure you learn these, too, for BC Calc, but that's not nearly enough to detract from the immense help that this book provides. I'm going to recommend that my school replace the Calculus textbooks with this book (or at least recommend that every student buy it)."

In the beginning of calculus, I was so lost that I did not understand a single thing in calculus. It didn't help when I was overloaded with homework.I knew I needed a solution, and I saw all the other students buy Barrons. However, upon looking at it, it looked freaky hard and I had a feeling I should get another book. Therefore, I went and got myself this book. It worked miracles for me from the very moment I started reading it, because it made calculus look so easy.I have absolutely no regrets buying this book, or if I do have one, it is that I didn't buy this book earlier. I see all my other classmates suffering while I was enjoying reading my Calculus book. In fact, I brought this book to every calculus class and it even replaced my textbook. I didn't even bother paying attention to my teacher anymore (although this is highly not recommended), and after a while I started to even ace my calculus tests. My friends called it my Math Bible and it was very true.Inevitably, I took an AB practice exam in January and scored a 5, but then when it came to the BC, I was only able to get a 4 at the most. Again, I looked to the ""Calculus Bible"" and I worked very hard on it. Obviously with hard work and effort, I ultimately scored a 5 on my BC exam, and ACED the Calculus class (considering my first semester of precalculus was a D+!)This book is a must buy for all calculus students and I found it more useful than my teacher. However, you MUST buy this book and actually spend a lot of time and dedication on it. I spent numerous hours during the holidays with this one book and in the end I reaped the rewards. If you don't spend enough time on this book, then this is absolutely useless. The poorer you are at Calculus presently, the more time you need to spend on this book to get a 5. Everybody should be able to get a 5 if you spend enough time on this book.Do NOT buy the Barrons book. After a while I decided to read more of the Barrons and found of confusing and hard. I was only able to get a 3 on the Barrons practice exams and it was ridiculous. Not only does it lower your confidence, it by no means helped my calculus because the concepts were far too hard and were not even tested by the College Board. Don't even bother buying Barrons, and now I have a policy of not even buying a Barrons book for anything based on my analysis of the Barrons calculus book. I also read the Barrons AP English book and it was ridiculously hard, so I only trust Princeton Review when it comes to cracking AP exams. Your life will be a lot easier if you buy this book and you will certainly be geared towards a 5 for the BC exam if you work hard on it.I am a living proof of the success of this book."

B000PS7EO2,Sweater Design in Plain English,,,,147/147,5.0,885686400,Excellent book to feed the creative spirit!,"I am an intermediate knitter who has been stifling my own creativity by knitting from commercial patterns for years. I have no knitters in my family, and taught myself to knit from books and help from art teachers in junior high school. Maggie Righetti is the knitting grandmother I never had, and always wanted. She has a wonderful sense of humor and a no-nonsense attitude of playfulness that cuts through the mystery and fear associated with design. Her first chapters are about the psychological barriers that keep knitters from taking control of their own craft, and this good-natured lecture is truly inspiring. Then she talks about the design issues and challenges associated with designing for REAL bodies of all types. Her attitude toward the fact that many people are bigger than the commercial designers assume, and that proportions can differ from that standard, but can still be beautiful, is refreshing. It's even--dare I say it--feminist! Righetti tells us to choose yarn that inspires us, then knit swatches with a variety of stitches and patterns. The swatch is not just to check gauge, but to let the yarn &quot;tell you what it wants to be.&quot; Some may find this silly, but it has helped me to let my creativity go, and I am now working with a beautiful, inspiring purple mohair that told me it wanted to be a short-sleeved evening sweater with simple lines. The yarn didn't want anything fancy to upstage it (as if that was possible). My only complaint with the book is that the practice sweaters given are not the most stylish, and as many design techniques are taught in the context of these sweaters, it can be difficult to find a technique you want to use if you don't go through each of the design projects in detail. I highly recommend this book, and plan to check out her other books."
B000PS7EO2,Sweater Design in Plain English,,,,117/119,5.0,1031875200,An excellent book,"When I first bought this book, my knitting experience was not matured enough to appreciate the depth of the information contained in this book. To be honest, I was even dissapointed since the style of sweaters shown was not stylish, the models wearing them were not stylish commercial models. The book is full of English text and has no eye-candy photos. So it had been sitting in my bookshelf for almost one year,I even thought about selling it.One Saturday afternoon, out of boredom, I decided to pick it up to read, laying on the bed. I could not believe that I could not discover the wisdom that the authour generously shares with us. My knitting knowleadge by then has grown to understand the authour's intention. Most of us do not have perfect bodies so that we need skills to knit to fit better. The models shown are real people with real mesurements! The sweaters are simples ones knitters tend to come back after ellaborately ornamented commercial patterns, which are often too-stylish to wear everyday.All these knitting skills for size-manipulation were right there in her book at my hand. I looked for those informaiton here and there scattered in many other books, but most of the time I could not find them in any where. For example, how to plan bust darts by short-rowing were something I always wanted to know.Her charting system is good model to copy. Math for knitting is well explined. If you can draw it and can do the math part of it, you can knit it. The price is very generous for the wealth of information contained. Probably, no color photos, no expensive commercial models have contributed greatly to its price. I am grad she made the book easy access to many people.I would reccomend this book to intermidiate to advanced knitters."

I find it to be amazing, especially for a journal of her travel experiences. She uses language which gives the book almost a flavor of fiction (I find that many nonfiction authors use very simple and often dry language, making such books harder to read). Occasionally she seems to have the perspective of a stereotypical European, but in general she manages to have a neutral viewpoint and tries to explain Indian customs from the point of view of Indians, as well as her reactions and those of her five year old daughter.As far as I'm concerned, one of the best parts of this book is the way that it describes various parts of India in amazing detail, as well as giving some background on the area. Unlike many tourists, Murphy is not content merely to wander around seeing usual sites; instead, she tries to get to out-of-the-way places, and to experience life as much like an Indian as she can (while acknowledging that this can never be fully accomplished). This is perhaps one of the best &quot;outsider&quot; descriptions that I have read, as she really makes and effort to understand her new surroundings."

0226115968,On Collective Memory (Heritage of Sociology Series),27.5,A1RA04L8E9MWIY,"S. Neufeld ""slappy""",15/16,4.0,1142467200,Collective Memory,"Halbwachs, Maurice. On Collective Memory. Translated and edited by Lewis A. Coser. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992.Memory reconstructs images from the past in the context of our social present. Maurice Halbwachs' important work on the formation of collective memory insists that any recalled events fundamentally exist as a function of group endeavour. These memories, and the different behaviours they sustain, rise from a selective process shaped by associations with classes, religions, and families. These social frameworks, he contends, provide the means to express memory through shared language and discourse. As such, all reconstructed pasts must draw on common conventions of beliefs and meanings. This stability accounts for the persistent strength of traditions, but also for changes to society that must first forge connections to past ways of understanding, in order to succeed.Beginning with family, Halbwachs examines the social contexts that determine collective memory. Although the wider meaning of family structure comes from society in general, the individual experiences within a family play a crucial role in forming memories through association. Traditions, legends, and proverbs, as well as emotional connections to places, allow the family unit to penetrate into the meanings the individual constructs in all other areas of life. The narrative and logic of family life, derived and adapted from societal norms, thus influence the forms that memory can take. Looking at religion, Halbwachs contends that formal doctrine represents a collective memory composed of rites and beliefs. He finds in religions a historical narrative of major historical events, manifested in more or less symbolic forms. Focusing on the Catholic Church, he demonstrates how a collective memory can adapt to new interpretations while retaining great internal stability and persistence of vision. He then turns to social classes, which he sees as something akin to Weberian status groups. He examines the workings of class traditions and legitimacy in the transitions between old and nouveau riche elites, arguing that while function defines class groups, meanings and assigned qualities come from the wider social relationships in which they participate. As societal hierarchies experience change, he argues, presentist justifications draw from traditions to construct a new collective memory where the new structure seems stable and acceptable.Evocative and thought provoking, Halbwachs' work offers an interesting approach to memory and its social construction. Similar to Hayden White's later argument of meta-narrative, he argues strongly, yet without much direct evidence, for the ubiquitous presence of societal pressures on individual creativity and personal spaces. Pierre Nora's work on memory in public history, and Eric Hobsbawm's on invention of traditions, further suggests the great influence of and legacy of Halbwachs. Nevertheless, several weak points stand out especially from the historian's perspective. In generalizing about religions, the annaliste-influenced author relies solely on evidence from a French author more conversant in Indo-Chinese Theravada traditions than in Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, and his argument then fails in wider application. Similarly, other historical cases lack specific evidence or detail and show a pronounced Eurocentric bias. For example, feudalism appears as the essential institution from which social classes emerge, yet this does not then explain how classes formed in the non-European world that did not experience the feudal structure. Yet criticizing a sociologist for writing bad history only goes so far, as on the whole he succeeds in presenting a useful model for understanding memories changing over time.From a philosophical and psychological approach, Halbwachs offers scholars a persuasive argument on the collective nature of memory and the recollection of the past as shaped by the present. Weak on history, he nonetheless provides important social considerations for investigating cultural memory. Halbwachs emphasizes the familial, class, and religious roots of individual knowledge of the past, and successfully explains how we select the images associated with historical events."

However, it is never dull reading, as it compares actual headlines, subheads and content of articles from the NY Times and compares them to coverage of the same subject, on the same day, in other media. The differences are startling - so much so in some cases that it seemed the Times wasn't even in the same room with other journalists.While I've known about the bias for years, and don't even watch network news anymore - I was fascinated by the subtlety with which the Times practices its craft. They understand the inertia of human nature, and exploit the fact that most people just don't have the time to dissect every news story they are exposed to each day. Imagine the sheer effort it takes each to day to twist the news so that it reflects a political or ideological agenda, but do it so well that few people are aware of it."

The art of taking a story, headline, or more often a poll and twisting it to fulfill their agenda is exposed by Kohn. When a story cannot be twisted, or is obviously counter to the beliefs of the NYT editors, it is not reported at all or buried in the sections of the paper that no one reads. However, any poll that shows disatisfaction with the War in Iraq gets front page treatment, while the accomplishments of our troops never reach page 1. The most disturbing story in the book is about the NYT crusade over all those supposed lost artifacts during the war. Lisa Ling even went to Iraq to find out where the were. The answer: In the museum. The NYT's exaggerated a story of looting of the museum(mostly chairs, desks, and other office supplies) to make the disapperance of 25 actual artifacts take attention away from the fall of the Saddam statue and celebrating Iraqi's (the artifact story first appeared the day after). Of course other lemming news sources took this story and ran with it, overshadowing the success of our troops.Not to say that this book is just for right-wingers who suspect widespread liberal bias. This is important for any credible journalistic student or news junkie who thinks of the Times as &quot;the newspaper of record&quot; that it used to be. The book is filled with clear-cut evidence that would anger any like-minded person, so much so, that at times can appear redundant. However, this is necessary to show the systematic nature of the editors and reporters, and make you switch to more reliable (or at least more honest) news sources."

Recently he become very aware of just how biased the New York Times is and decided to document how it reports the news in a bias manor.The author says the true debate is not about media bias, but news bias, how the news is reported. The whole focus of this book is to document how the New York Times now reports its opinions as news. Along the way it teaches the reader how to be more critical when reading the news and how to read between the lines.Since all major papers subscribe to the New York Times News service, the NY Times greatly influences what is considered news, and how to report the news.The old style reporting was very focused on:I have six honest serving men;They taught me all I knew;Their names are Where and What and When;and How and Why and Whoby Rudyard KiplingIn reporting news, a journalist would often use the &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; style, where you put the most important details first. A good news story tries to answer Kipling's six uestions, and tries to answer them at the beginning, in the lead sentence. By only reporting one side in the lead sentence a journlist can easily slant the news story. Most people don't read past the first paragraph on a lot of stories and are left with the impression from just the first paragraph.According to Bob Kohn most modern newspapers seem to see their mission now as influencing public opinion. The Times distorts the Facts by omission, distortion, falsification, and emphsis. The author goes into example after example of how they do this. The Times will often include the opinions of others in the stories when the opinions agree with the Times, or not in include them when the opinions disagree. The Times uses positive labels for those it likes, and negative labels for those it hates.The author uses the book as a call to action for the New York Times, he asks them to keep their opinions in the opinion section and just report the facts.I found the book well written, and educational."

What Bob Kohn in JOURNALISTIC FRAUD believes is that this power has over the last decade been funneled to present a view that is decidedly left wing liberal. Kohn draws a careful distinction between those parts of the NYT that are opinion and those are 'straight' news. No one, least of all Kohn, claims that the op-ed sections cannot favor one view over another. Indeed, it is the duty of any newspaper to showcase whatever political underpinning it wishes. However, in the case of Arthur Surlzberger, the publisher, the NYT presents the news as little more than disguised opinion. It takes some tricky writing to accomplish this, so tricky, in fact, that Kohn suggests that such proselytizing cannot be by chance.Until the mid 1980s, Kohn notes that the NYT was reasonably evenhanded in its partiality. The front page was for straight news while the op-eds were for mind molding. What disturbs Kohn, and by implication most of the NYT's non leftist oriented idealogical readers, is that Surlzberger's staff writers abruptly shifted the NYT into an attack vehicle against all things conservative or Republican.Most of JOURNALISTIC FRAUD is a careful analysis of the many ways that a newspaper can impart a predeternined spin to any story. By using direct quotes from the NYT, Kohn deflects criticism that his own book is no more than a political counterpunch. Kohn reaffirms that the time-honored concept of placing the 'who' and the 'what' at the lead of any article is the surest way to avoid setting the reader's mind on a path desired by that article's writer. When a writer phrases his introduction to begin with one of the other 'w's' then Kohn notes that impartiality has degraded into partiality.Kohn ends his book by listing how the NYT can reclaim its previous preeminent position as the bastion of journalistic integrity. He perhaps overoptimistically sees potential for change within the NYT's editorial office. Whether such change can actually happen is less likely to be as a result of a change of heart in the publisher and more likely to be as a result in a bottom line evaporation of readership. In either case, JOURNALISTIC FRAUD is a potent reminder that the mighty can fall despite decades of seeming pomp and power."

In the Sept 15 issue of the New Yorker Magazine, ""Journalistic Fraud"" is mentioned in a piece by Peter J. Boyer called, "" The Jesus War: Mel Gibson's Obsession"". The article is about the controversy over Mel Gibson's new film concerning the life and death of Jesus. Here's the part where Mel Gibson talks about his disgust for the New York Times:The next morning, Robyn Gibson (Mel Gibson's wife) asked her husband not to read the newspaper until he had had his coffee. The Los Angeles Times had published a column, by Tim Rutten, that likened Gibson to ""an unwholesomely willful child playing with matches. The immediate temptation may be to let the little brat learn the lesson that burnt fingers will teach.""Gibson was still fuming when he reached his Icon office, where another special screening was scheduled, this one for the television evangelist Dr. Robert Schuller. The preacher's entourage arrived and took their places in the screening room, without Schuller, who had apparently got lost inside the building's corridors. While waiting for him, Gibson talked about the column, and observed, to general agreement, that "" the L.A. Times, its an anti-Christian publication, as is the New York Times.""A moment later, Schuller walked in, with a book in his hand, which he presented to Gibson. It was a polemic called, ""Journalistic Fraud: How the New York Times Distorts the News and Why it Can No Longer Be Trusted,"" by Bob Kohn.It hits the stores this week, and we expect it to be on the best-seller list, ""Schuller said. ""And the author is very prominent, Bob Kohn, very weathly..... and Jewish."""" Hey! That's a great gift!"" Gibson said, brightening. Thank you.The world is beginning to recognize how bad the news is getting at the New York Times. Christians are complaining the ""newspaper of record"" is anti-Christian. Jews are complaining the Times is anti-Israel. Kohn's book shows you exactly the techniques the Times uses to crusade against issues and causes with which it disagrees, such as religion.

Welcome to the Orwellian World of 2007.My father grew up pouring through ""The Grey Lady"" each day. Like most of his friends, liberal or conservative, he stopped reading this rag a few years back. He didn't need news stories turned into anti-american op-eds by a clever staff of New School alumni lunatics who place, omit, add, and throw in subjective words wherever they find fit, simply to please their left wing elite establishment. Is it any wonder the Muslim Jihadists quote from the NY Crimes? Was the fact that their former ombudsman confirmed an inherent lefty bias not enough? Was the firing of affirmative action reporters who made up stories in their apartment not enough? What else? This paper has less credibility than any of your local weekly fish wraps. Sadly though, since most city papers get their international stories from the Times, and Starbucks and every public or collegiate library has a subscription, these Marxists are still sailing along arrogantly, giving away national security secrets, burying pro-american stories, leading with stories about the ""poor Muslims,"" etc. They are the worst.

(That was before they defaced General Petraus and much else. Hyperlinks were included in original article, but not on Amazon review.)---------------------------------------------------------------------It has become more and more transparent that the New York Times leans not only left, but far enough away from mainstream America so as to reach out to our enemies in the War on Terror. To then defend themselves, arrogantly acting as if Americans are out of line for doubting their intentions, displays a sort of elitism that is unparalleled even in the long history of ""the Grey Lady."" With The Times ""above the law"" mentality, it is noteworthy to look at some of their treasonous publications within the War on Terror.Here then are the top ten most morale--lowering, disingenuous pieces from the NYT over just the past three years:10. ""The Deaths at Gitmo"" (June 12, 2006)In the world of the Times, anything that makes the American military look juvenile or ruthless makes good copy. The Guantanamo Bay ordeal has been a favorite of theirs for some time. In this long--winded diatribe, the editorial staff laments that so many Gitmo prisoners were never charged with crimes, discusses their despair and blames President Bush for creating this ""netherworld.""9. ""One month of Abu Ghraib front page stories"" (May 1--June 1, 2004)Two years ago, for the entire month of May, the Times ran at least one story per day, demeaning our troops and federal government for the way the Abu Ghraib prison was run. Each article is linked.8. ""Despite Appeals, Chaos Still Stalks the Sudanese"" (July 18, 2004)Phyllis Chesler's piece entitled, ""When you can't say Muslim!"" discusses a Times piece (one of many, no doubt) in which the writers tiptoe around sounding politically incorrect and culturally insensitive, refusing to label the terrorists as Arabs or Muslims, much less radical extremists.7. ""The Mystery of the Insurgency"" (May 15, 2005)James Bennet pleads with the Times to cease labeling our mass--murdering enemies ""insurgents"" and define them properly. Christoper Hitchens also helps makes sense of the Times ""multicultural"" madness. Needless to say, more than a year later, the Times and the media in general have not acquiesced.6. ""NY Times Blows Cover of Key Counter Terror Agent"" (August, 2004).As reported above by Newsmax. Enough said.5. ""Despite his Troubles, Arafat Endures as a Leader and Symbol"" (July 27, 2004)A little more than three months before his death, the Times' Greg Myre, like Jimmy Carter and too many others, was still lauding the ""Palestinian"" leader. Although the article is not a hagiography, it does not condemn Arafat, discusses his longevity, and notes, among much else, that ""he remains the enduring symbol of Palestinian aspirations to full nationhood.""4. ""All the News that's fit to Print?"" (March, 2003)The National Review's Tom Gross discusses at length how the Times picks and chooses which deaths and destructive activities to report and photograph more often, and with more (or less) coverage. He also debunks the oudated myths that the paper is ""pro--Israel.""3. ""Passive Voice Genocide"" (August 3, 2005)Jason Maoz of the Jewish Press, writing for Front Page Magazine, discusses many of the same mistaken priorities that Gross did two years prior. However, Maoz goes further, discussing the word structure of certain headlines and how they can obfuscate the matters at hand. He concludes by noting the Times' unflappable concerns over dead ""Palestinians."" Is that really Pro--Israel?2. ""Is the NY Times a Liberal newspaper?"" (July 25, 2004)Daniel Okrent, the former ombudsman of the paper, delicately explains how the Times leans left. He naturally stops short of saying anything insidious, and in a May 2006 interview I heard with him on National Public Radio, he recanted much of this saying he regretted the first few words of his piece: ""Of course it is.""1.""Shouting Fire in a Crowded Theater"" (June 26, 2006)David Limbaugh's most recent piece featuring the Times' most recent (and perhaps most deplorable) anti--american actions. Limbaugh explains the legal ramifications of the paper's disclosure of secure information, notes the Times' responses and elaborates on the long--term effects on this story.Basically, as you can especially deduce from the recent pieces that harass the Bush Administration, aid our enemies, and betray America's trust, the Times shows the hypocritical propensity to clamor for certain checks and balances on the executive branch, yet turn a silent ear toward those same checks upon the legislative, judicial and, of course, themselves. That, along with their recalcitrance to call the enemy by name and denounce his actions, explains why so many Americans no longer trust the Times as a viable source of news."

B000O19CJA,Let Love Come Last,,,,21/21,5.0,900028800,A must read for anyone who has children,"Taylor Caldwell has written a moving story of a quiet and wise woman who marries a man driven to power by his childhood agonies and poverty. Although the story takes place in 1879-1908, it is particularly poignant for parents today. He spoils his children by lavishing them with everything he has, and in so doing, as observed by his long suffering wife, he avenges his own childhood suffering at the hands of a world run by greed and the twisting of Christianity and capitalism into an unholy alliance. William Prescott never achieves the love of his children which he craves so intensely. Instead, his adopted and first son turns out to be the best of all. His wife constantly shields him from the slings and arrows of his children and herself leads a loveless life, because of his obsession with his children, and because he forgot that one should never put children before a loving spouse. This story is so relevant now where so many parents refuse to discipline their children in their own efforts to exorcise their own often overblown perceptions of an unhappy childhood. This book is really important for new parents to read. The profit they can realise from living with the Prescotts in this book is immense.This is one of Taylor Caldwell's most important books."

B000GLO42S,Second Coming Attractions,,A1L10XK94U8YQL,Henry W. Wagner,0/0,4.0,1189468800,Prill skewers the inspirational film industry,"David Prill's first two novels won him a cult following among horror fans who appreciate his warped world view and macabre sense of humor. In The Unnatural, embalming took baseball's place as the national pastime. Serial Killer Days told the story of a small Minnesota town that actually celebrates the annual visits of a serial killer. This time out, Prill targets the Christian inspirational film industry, with the story of Good Samaritan Films, producers of such epics as The Man Who Rose Again and Three Strikes and You're Saved.The main character of Second Coming Attractions is Leviticus Speck, son of Good Samaritan founder Noah Speck. Leviticus wonders if the films produced by Good Samaritan are relevant to today's Christian audience. Good Samaritan is not the powerhouse it once was, as evidenced by a declining market share and a challenge from an upstart, Blood of the Lamb Films. This new company produces films with grim anti-abortion messages, usurping markets that Good Samaritan once dominated.Leviticus, obsessed with his rivals, is willing to do anything to thwart them. Introduced to a hot property that seems tailor made for Blood of the Lamb, Leviticus pretends his studio is interested in the project even though he has no intention of ever making the film. What follows is grim farce, as Leviticus and young screenwriter Nicholas Puckett collaborate on a script for an anti-abortion action film called ""The Fetal Detective"". The title character (nicknamed ""The Unborn Avenger"") is a trash talking, gun-toting fetus who dispatches his pro-choice enemies from the womb.Once again, Prill creates convincing, sympathetic characters and places them in a world which, though ridiculous, is so fully imagined that readers have to buy in. Along the way, he demonstrates his talent for offbeat, off the wall humor, all the while delivering a message against intolerance and one dimensional thinking. Whether writing about a pistol-packing fetus, a support group for spouses of actors who portray deities, or abortion clinic violence, Prill writes authority and conviction.Although Prill comes close to overdoing it at times (naming a character ""Una Bonner"" will probably make you groan out loud), he walks a fine line without becoming preachy. Nobody writes like Prill, and nobody covers the same bizarre terrain."

Charles Erlandson,0/0,4.0,1312675200,"First Treatment of the Oxford Movement: Good, but Limited","The Oxford Movement was such a potent force in the Church of England in the nineteenth century that an adequate understanding of it is essential to students of Anglicanism and of the history of the Church of England. The first book written to promulgate an understanding of the Oxford Movement is R. W. Church's 1891 ""The Oxford Movement: Twelve Years, 1833-1845. As the first book on the topic, Church's book has had a large influence on the literature of the Oxford Movement over the years. It continues to be a good introduction to the subject but is lacking in a few ways as well.Church was himself in an ideal situation from which to write such a book, being first a student and then a tutor at Oriel College, Oxford at the same time as John Henry Newman and John Keble. In fact, Church became a disciple and close friend of Newman, which helps explain in part why Church's view of the Oxford Movement is written largely through the lens of Newman and his dynamic, turbulent thought. This is at least one reason why Church considers the Oxford Movement as a twelve year period (from Keble's Assize Sermon in 1833 until Newman's joining the Roman Catholic Church in 1845). Until recently, most scholars of the Oxford Movement have joined Church in reading the Oxford Movement primarily through the lens of Newman. However, Church's work would have been more powerful and useful if it had dealt with the aftermath of Newman's departure and its effect on the Oxford Movement.Church writes with a terse, narrative style and focuses primarily on the principal players of the Oxford Movement. His first-hand knowledge of the people involved is one strength of the book, and his narrative style makes the book easy to read. However, the focus on people means that to some degree a more objective analysis of the meaning and import of the Oxford Movement was left to other writers. Church is clear in his Advertisement that he did not pretend to write a history of the movement or adequately to judge it but intended to preserve a contemporary memorial of a ""true and noble effort which passed before my eyes, with all that was in it of self-devotion, affectionateness, and high and refined and varied character . . . .""In summary, Church's work is a good one but limited in a number of ways. Modern students of the Oxford Movement should especially read Nockles ""The Oxford Movement in Context."""

But of course it's brilliant if it's by Hengel,"Martin Hengel is the single most respected and most famous biblical scholar in the world. Every scrap he produces is translated (he writes in German). This collection of essays is a must read for anyone who is interested in biblical scholarship. However, it is NOT for beginners.The essays cover a variety of topics, but generally deal the development of Christology in earliest Christianity, especially in the first five to twenty years after the resurrection. ""Paul...regarded Jesus to be the promised Messiah of Israel (which)..he holds in common with all the gospels (p 7).

0965220257,GPS Land Navigation,,,,83/83,5.0,905385600,Everyone interested in navigation must read this book,"The book's objective is to remove the mystery surrounding this new technology so that anyone who owns a GPS receiver can become an expert in its use. GPS Land Navigation has 6 chapters that cover everything from hardware (GPS, compass, altimeter), to software (maps, coordinates, bearings, etc.), to skills (trip planning, route finding, map reading, etc.) Three appendices contain: elevation, latitude and longitude of the highest points in each county; the coordinates of each state's capital building; and, the coordinates for the junction of every U.S. Interstate with either another U.S. Interstate or an U.S. Highway. You can enter this into a GPS receiver and use it a-priori to navigate to that specific location. The last appendix has detailed comparison information for every handheld GPS in production as of early 1997.Chapter 1 Introduction to GPS discusses the NAVSTAR (U.S.) and GLONASS (Russian) satellite navigation systems. The NAVSTAR system includes 24 satellites and their coordinating ground stations. Each satellite carries four atomic clocks, and continuously sends radio signals, which GPS receivers use to calculate position. NAVSTAR is designed so that any location on earth will have line of sight access to at least six satellites at all times (as long as there is an unobstructed view from horizon to horizon). Simply stated, a GPS receiver determines its position by measuring the time it takes radio signals to travel from four satellites to the receiver. Each satellite simultaneously sends its precise location and software in the receiver triangulates these to get a fix. GPS receivers provide accuracy between 40 and 100 feet and chapter 1 provides an excellent discussion as to the determinants of precision and accuracy. Tidbit of information, GPS receivers are constantly updated by the atomic clocks in the GPS satellites, so as long as you have one you will know the EXACT time.Chapter 2 GPS Hardware discusses the essential equipment needed for navigation. Surprise! GPS does not eliminate the need for traditional navigation instruments (compass and altimeter) but rather it complements them. A GPS receiver provides three essential pieces of data for backcountry land navigation: 1) position in terms of coordinates, 2) direction between any two waypoints, 3) distance between any two waypoints. This chapter gives you lots of information about how GPS receivers generate data. One piece of data that GPS receivers don't provide is actual directions on the ground. In most field applications, you need a compass to know which direction you are facing and which way to walk. Chapter 2 discusses baseplate, mirror, and sighting compasses. It explains how to obtain, set, and then follow a bearing (either from a map or a GPS). Finally, it summarizes magnetic declination, magnetic interference, and magnetic inclination. If you already know what these are, cool. If not, you'd better read the book. Finally, GPS receivers also display altitude, but for reasons discussed in Chapter 4, it isn't very accurate. So carry an altimeter and read the book on how to use it.Chapter 3 Maps Maps are the single most important source of information in the backcountry. If you practice, you can guestimate where you are and get to another point using only a map and compass. If you plan in advance, you can navigate with only a GPS receiver and compass. However, with a topographic map, GPS, compass, and altimeter you can determine exactly where you are, plan precisely how to get anywhere with pinpoint accuracy, and even estimate how long it will take to get there. This chapter contains one of the best descriptions of maps that I have read. It covers all the classic things such as quadrangles, map-scale, distances, and various map series. Then it goes into some theory I had never really thought too much about. For example, did you know that maps and coordinate data from the continental U.S. are based on either NAD27, NAD83, or WGS84 datum? I never even knew such things existed much less why they might be important. But, you must tell your GPS receiver what datum the map you are using is based on. Chapter 3 introduces the concepts of angular (latitude/longitude) and rectangular (UTM) coordinate systems (whoa, no kidding, coordinate systems are critical) . This chapter also gives one of the most understandable descriptions (illustrated) of contour lines that I have read. There's even more. Chapter 3 tells you what all the information printed along the margins and corners of maps means. For example latitude and longitude are labeled at each of the four corners and are also tickmarked along the neatlines at 2.5 minute intervals (remember this you'll hear it again).Chapter 4 Coordinate Systems may be a bit arcane but it's the meat of the book (&quot;you can take the cheat or run the meat.&quot;). Simply stated, coordinate systems are the fundamental link between maps and the world they represent. Six digits of latitude and seven digits of longitude are all it takes to specify a location within 50 feet of precision anywhere on earth! A GPS receiver provide these digits. Unfortunately, merely knowing that you are at 34o35' 00&quot; N, 084o12'30&quot; W does not automatically translate to about a klick NNE of Cochran Falls in most peoples' minds. It does however if you grok coordinates. This chapter discusses angular coordinates and UTM rectangular coordinates in comprehensible terms (GPS receivers can be set to use either angular or UTM coordinates for navigation).Chapter 5 Directions puts all the theory together. True North, Grid North, Magnetic North, Azimuths, Bearings, Great Circles, and Rhumb Lines all become clear and you are ready to go from anywhere to anywhere-else even if you don't know where either of them are relative to you.Chapter 6 GPS Skills tells you how to use the theory. It explains how to use a GPS without a map, or with a map (which is what most of us do), and what to do when (horrors of horrors) your GPS receiver breaks down."

This book still holds up as the best I have seen.Its primary focus is the use of GPS as a component in land navigation. The material on topographic maps, compass navigation, datums, coordinate systems, and the possible sources of error that are unique to GPS is what makes this book more than a how-to-be-a-techie recguide. It is presented and explained in such a clear and efficient manner that this book is both a valuable resource and an interesting book to just pick up and read.The chapter on GPS equipment is outdated, but that information can be obtained from salespeople or manufacturers' websites. The cautions and explanations regarding Selective Availability are no longer relevant, since SA was switched off in May 2000. The rest of the material is timeless and fundamental and applies to anything locational. Still, it would be good if a second edition could be written to get rid of the outdated material.Anyone who takes the time to learn the material covered in this book will gain much more use from a GPS unit and topographic maps. You need to know more than your latitude and longitude. This book will give you the background you need in order to know what your GPS unit is telling you and how to use that information correctly."

It's loaded with easy to read and understand information that the GPS owners manuals don't tell you. It explains about UTM (universal tranverse mercator) as an alternative to the normal latitude/longitude mode of operation. This mode is a grid system that shows you EXACTLY where you are on any topographic map at any time without the use of any mapping tools needed; it is so very simple. Once you read the section on UTM you will be able to use it with confidence the same day. GPS Land Navigation discusses how 2-D (2-dimensional) mode can cause a serious error in your travels to a destinaton. You could be off by up to one mile; again something the owners manuals fail to tell you. GPS Land Navagation explains how important the use of the proper datum is and how using the wrong (WGS84 vs. NAD27 CONUS) one will throw you off your target destination by up to 200 yards.

B000KYXXJG,The Face in the Abyss,,AD4XBTBQYQBT3,s.ferber,9/10,3.0,1080259200,A BOOK OF REAL MERRITT,"Abraham Merritt's &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; first appeared as a short story in a 1923 issue of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine. It would be another seven years before its sequel, &quot;The Snake Mother,&quot; appeared in &quot;Argosy,&quot; and yet another year before the book-length version combined these two tales, in 1931. It is easy to detect the book's provenance as two shorter stories, as the first third of the novel is pretty straightforward treasure-hunting fare, while the remainder of the book takes a sharp turn into lost-world fantasy, of the kind popularized by H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this novel we meet Nick Graydon, an American miner, who is searching for lost Incan loot with three of the nastiest compadres you can imagine. In the Peruvian wastes, they come across a mysterious girl, and are led by her toward Yu-Atlanchi, the so-called Hidden Land. Graydon's cohorts suffer a mysterious fate, but Graydon himself goes on to discover Yu-Atlanchi's many wonders. He meets the Snake Mother, one of Merritt's finest creations: a half snake/half girl entity who is countless aeons old and possessed of ancient wisdom. The Snake Mother is similar in nature to the Silent Ones of Merritt's first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; but is a much more fleshed-out character. It seems that Graydon has stumbled into Yu-Atlanchi just as civil war is about to break out there. Nimir, an evil lord whom the Snake Mother had imprisoned ages ago, has returned, and is intent on using his weapons of mind control and superscience to rule the world. Merritt does ultimately treat us to a nifty battle between the forces of Nimir (aided by his lizard men, dinosaurs and various weapons) and the Snake Mother (aided by her invisible flying lizards and assorted way-out armaments). But before we get to that battle, Merritt also dishes out a dinosaur hunt, a dinosaur race, a tour through the Cavern of Lost Wisdom, a garden of evil, mind control, spirit possession, spider-men (and NOT of the Peter Parker variety!), and some fascinating history of and philosophizing by the Snake Mother. It's all wonderfully pulpy and improbable stuff, but Merritt throws quite a bit into the book to keep the reader well entertained.On the down side, &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; does not feature as much of the wonderful purple prose that made earlier Merritt works such as &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster&quot; so special. This book seems to have been written more quickly and, in some places, almost carelessly. For example, in one scene, the moon is said to be rising from the west! In another, Graydon is said to have only one pistol, under his arm, although the pistol he's had at his waist is never mentioned again. That Cavern of Lost Wisdom seems so easy to come across that it's impossible for the reader to believe that it has been undiscovered for thousands of years. Merritt is also guilty of occasional fuzzy writing in &quot;Face&quot; (such as when he refers to a &quot;three foot parapet&quot;; is that three feet high or three feet wide, or what?), and much of the geography of the incessant tunnel crawling that takes place in the book is hard to follow. But perhaps this is deliberate on Merritt's part. Not all of our questions are concretely answered by the novel's end, and Graydon's theorizing is apparently meant to suffice. But I suppose that this is all nitpicking. What &quot;Face&quot; ultimately does succeed at is in providing action-packed escapism, constant imagination and colorful wonders. What an incredible Hollywood blockbuster this would make! Anyway, as it is, this is yet another fine fantasy from Abraham Merritt."

Kunt ends up associating with the toughest elements in the prison.The toughest gang has an ace. They have a hole which allows them to gambol about outside the prison whenever their prison schedule allows. They also have the perfect alibi for any crime: They are in prison. Naturally, that have to commit a crime. Kunt, not a real criminal, doesn't want to rob a bank. He uses all of his practical joking experience to try to prevent the robbery. In the end, he can't prevent it forever.Kunt finally finds happiness when one of his fellow prisoners accidentally finds a solution to the lifelong problem of his god-awful name."

The plot is described in the reviews above, and it's funny enough in itself. But Westlake tucks and stuffs hilarious bits and asides into it as compulsively as Harry Kunt sets off his little stunts. I can't count how many books I've read that I have really loved since this one, or how many really laugh-out-loud funny ones, including especially the late Mr. Westlake's.

Each card in this new deck is illustrated in the book. Each image has deep healing meanings. The descriptions of the cards are relevant to their meanings in a reading, to the imagery of the illustration, and to the healing qualities of the flowers and their essences. What is most impressive to me is the way this isn't just another Tarot deck. This is a truly new symbolism, and it discovers a new dimension, too--based on plants (root, stem, leaf, fruit) structures as metaphors for human life. And there are 5 more totally new cards (conceptually new!) called energy cards. I've used both the book and the cards in readings and the energy cards create a really vital new dimension to readings. I also like the dreams and poetry that go with each card, and the information about flower essences. Anyone interested in working with alternative medicine like flower essences will get a lot out of the wisdom in this book. Anyone interested in Tarot and divination will find that this isn't just a system for telling about what is happening, because each card that shows in a reading really is also a healing flower essence. There is information in the book about how to get the essences that go with the cards. A complete healing system!"

Girton,47/48,5.0,896832000,This cookbook is really the right stuff,"Anne Willan's In &amp; Out of the Kitchen in Fifteen Minutes or Less is without question the single best cookbook I have ever read. (I haven't read La Varenne yet). Each of the 100 recipes for four is clearly presented, most often on a single page. Necessary ingredients and tools are shown in a list at the left of the page, with instructions anyone can follow to the right. A brief summary of all the steps is shown at the bottom, so an experienced cook can save even more time the second time through. My only complaint? the font that shows the fractions is small enough to make it sometimes hard to tell if the measure was, for example, 1/2 cup or 1/3 cup.The book is also one of the most beautiful I have seen. The astonishingly well-designed color photographs of the food do so much more than decorate the text. They enhance your understanding of how to prepare the meal, and lead you to consider what a meal can truly be. Although not a chef at all, (and I'm certainly not), you may find yourself asking ""am I the kind of person who can make this delicious and magical trout with fennel and herbs en papillote?"" and answering ""heck, if it only takes 14 minutes, then why not?""Indeed, even if you never make a single one of these easy and surprising recipes, one of which has only two ingredients (sorry, that would be telling, and no it's not loaves and fishes), you will be happy that you have read this book. If you want to see what a busy director of a cooking school makes when she cooks for herself, then join her in the kitchen and listen to her tell you thoughtfully exactly how she does it. In 15 minutes. Or, of course, less."

Well, it was. In all of my years of cooking, I could only think of a handful of complete, well-balanced meals that I could fix in 15 minutes or less. I was hopeful this was a compilation of her tried and trues that really did work. I was disappointed to find so many shortcuts. There were many recipes that gave additional instructions to complete the meal if more time allowed. I could take any recipe and do only to half of it, but I want a perfectly finished dish in a short amount of time without sacrificing quality and taste. A better approach would have been for Anne to compile dishes that are, by their nature, fast, easy, and tasty, and ditch the 15 minute time limit. It came across as if she were throwing things together just to adhere to a rigid limit of time. I would recommend instead, &quot;How to Cook Without a Book&quot; by Pam Anderson for truly fast, wonderful, REAL meals for everyday eating."

But I've never found a quick minestrone or spaghetti sauce recipe which tastes as good as one that cooks slowly, letting the flavors &quot;marry&quot; and blend...and the recipes in this book fall short of my time-tested favorites.On the other hand, most of the recipes aren't bad and, if you're tired and hungry, odds are you'll find plenty to satisfy here. In fact, the minestrone in this book (which does indeed take about 15 mintues to cook) is far superior to any canned or fast food soup I've had, containing a subtle blend of zucchini, plum tomatoes, kidney beans, Parmesan cheese and other fresh vegetables and spices. It smells and tastes yummy and is plenty satisfying - if not perfect (I admit it; I have high expectations). Ditto for the spaghetti sauces, desserts and salads. They're fine, just not superior.Most of the recipes in this book fall into the Gourmet or Exotic category, so steer clear of this one if you don't like to try unusual combinations or flavors (examples include Fettucine with Coriander &amp; Ginger and Salad of Fig-Stuffed Chicken with Blue Cheese). Most kids wouldn't like the recipes here, unless they're budding gourmands. Who does that leave? Well, there's plenty here for the vegetarian who wants to expand his or her horizons, so this might be a good gift choice for veggie lovers on your list - as well as for more experimental cooks who are short on time."

It is a chance to read about a Hawaii that is different from the one we see today on vacations or in the movies and TV.The collection includes writers that are explorers, missionaries, adventurers and those who came to work and stayed. There are even pieces written by Mark Twain, Jack London and R. L. Stevenson. It is striking how good much of the writing is by the non-writers in the group; makes it plain how much better most of us could be today to write in such an engaging manner.This is a good book to read either before or during your next visit to Hawaii-the pieces are short so you can read one or two when you find the moment-perhaps with a Mai Tai at sunset. It has enhanced my already great appreciation for being in the Islands.Don't miss the introduction by James Michener.

Although he is a womaniser and a sometimes drunkard, he has such charm and charisma that almost everyone with whom he comes into contact cannot help but like him.He is constantly in debt but it never seems to get him down.

0072223847,Oracle9i JDeveloper Handbook,,A26DIGB1FDXKYZ,"Martin ""martinrleon""",12/12,5.0,1060041600,An excellent source for newbies or JVeterans,"I am actually a Lotus Notes programmer by trade (OK, stop laughing!) who has been dabbling with a variety of other programming languages for many years (C++, Java, VB, C#, etc), so I have had some exposure to Object Oriented programming and developer GUI's going back to GWBasic. I have also recently begun to dabble with Oracle 8i and 9i, installing them on my laptop and on a Linux box so that I would have Oracle available to me as a learning resource. I am by no stretch of the imagination a programming wizard, but I can quickly make myself useful in any programming environment with good reference material as my starting point.I recently decided that I needed to try to put myself in a better position in the job market by extending my working knowledge of both Java and Oracle. Oracle JDeveloper appeared to be the best tool for accomplishing this objective and the Oracle 9i JDeveloper Handbook has proven to be an excellent learning source for such a vast product.There are several factors that make JDeveloper a complex and powerful tool. First of all, it allows you to create and edit all things Java -- from basic Java classes and simple Java console applications, to JavaBeans, JSP pages, Swing/AWT Java applications and applets, Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), servlets, you name it. Additionally, the JDeveloper product has a class modeling tool that at first I thought was just for drawing UML diagrams, but it actually can be used the way that UML is supposed to be used -- to produce actual database tables that embody the properties that you specify in the JDeveloper GUI. All of this functionality is already a massive undertaking but then you add on to that the use of Oracle Business Components for Java (BC4J) and things get really hairy.Probably one of the most difficult things to wrap my brain around is the BC4J architecture, not because it is confusing but because it is very powerful and seems to be very extensive and very well thought out. I can say this because in the JDeveloper Handbook the examples and the scenarios that are used to explain the BC4J object model and architecture effectively convey the benefit and flexibility of using BC4J.JDeveloper is very integrated with the Oracle database platform. It very quickly and easily can read your database tables and do a lot of the grunt work of putting an object model over your database structures using BC4J. And, as I mentioned earlier, you can &quot;forward engineer&quot; your tables by creating your UML diagrams first and using those to create the underlying database tables (aren't tables just there to enable the object model to persist?). As I continued through the book, the BC4J concepts (which I must emphasize are a very important part of this product) become more and more familiar and I see their value more and more.This is all to say that the JDeveloper tool is much more extensive than I first realized and obviously has a very high level of integration with the Oracle database platform. There is a lot of ground to cover and this book methodically plods through it. For newbie's, it covers everything from using the IDE to debugging, with plenty of examples for creating a wide variety of the different kinds of projects JDeveloper supports. For old Java veterans, I think what you'll appreciate the most is the material on BC4J and how much easier it's going to make your Java / Oracle programming. The book covers it all at what I feel is a good level of detail with a lot of examples and scenarios that make the concepts clear and useful.I am really glad I bought this book and I have only read half-way through it! I know I will be reading every page and will continue to refer to it for all the different kinds of examples that it covered. There is no way I could have tapped into half of the power of this tool without this book. Thanks to Peter Koletzke, Dr. Paul Dorsey, and Dr. Avrom Faderman for effectively taking on such massive challenge."

The book is 1000 pages as it is. To develop using JDev, you need Java, SQLJ, JDBC, XML, etc. Do you expect to get all of that in one book? Read the intro, it SAYS that it doesn't cover those topics.

The overview section of J2EE architecture is nicely demystifying, and the second part of the book (the in depth discussion of BC4J) is very well written and clear.Sure, you can learn JDev without this handbook, but messing about with it until you do is NOT an efficient way to learn it.

When I began reading it, I winced over the cautions about who should read the book. Although I am proficient in Access and have done some VBScript and JavaScript client-side applications, I am new to J2EE and to Oracle. However, I hoped that reading the book would give me a good explanation of the basics of JDeveloper and that I could fill in the holes later. Unfortunately, the book did not provide many explanations of the basics and some of those attempts were pretty vague. For instance, it was not until somewhere shortly after page 400 that the distinction between Views and Entities became clear. In reviewing the earlier 'explanations' with the benefit of hindsight, they still did not seem to be very clear about what was just pointers and what held actual data.The authors could, with very little additional effort, have provided short, clear explanations for basic concepts. That would have greatly improved the readability for a wider range of readers.

While I am comfortable using an LDAP browser to manage our users in LDAP, I really wanted more of an idea about how to set up and run an LDAP directory, so I bought this book to help me understand LDAP schemas.While this book does describe a lot of the background to LDAP directories, it really didn't do much to fill in what I am missing. How do you design an LDAP schema? How do you know when to use ou=, o=, etc.?On the plus side, I really *DID* appreciate the overview of various LDAP products currently available, and was pleased to see that all of the LDAP products I have used at work (OpenLDAP, iPlanet Directory Server and, or course, Active Directory) were described, along with their relative strengths and weaknesses. However, I really expected a little more meat--and maybe not quite as much background--about implementing an LDAP directory than I found in this book.In short, if you want a general overview of LDAP directories, this might be what you want, but if you are looking for a ""how to"" guide, you probably should keep looking."

Then this book is for you! If your task is to create a directory infrastructure for a whole company or organization, ""LDAP Directories Explained"" could be a perfect first read, but after it you will want to turn to a more comprehensive book. This book also does not claim to contain installation guides for any specific LDAP server implementation (though it has some links on this topic in one of its appendixes).""LDAP Directories Explained"" is well organized, specialized terms are being defined before they are used, there are no obvious typos and no useless digressions. Brian Arkills does a perfect job to make you understand the basic concepts of LDAP. He also makes you feel, that the LDIF-syntax which looks so deterring and obscure at the first look is in fact quite simple and he teaches you how to query an LDAP server. This is exactly the knowledge that is sufficent for 90% of the IT staff concerned with LDAP. Brain Arkill conveys it on only 200 pages. In the second half of the book he assesses three major LDAP-implementations: OpenLDAP, Microsoft Active Directory and Netscape Directory Server. We use neither of these, but the book was invaluable to me though.I remember from my last job that the basic concepts of LDAP never were adequately explained in the Microsoft curricula, so I can also heartily recommend this book to Windows sysadmins."

But after reading this book, I still don't have a clear understanding of basic concepts such as namespaces. One section led me to believe that a DNS-based namespace was the same as an LDAP hierarchical namespace, but then I had my doubts after reading another section. Are cn, ou, dc, and uid all object classes? I have heard that LDAP does not respond to a client with a pass/fail response, but there is a discussion of result codes in response to such operations. What are theses codes? When and how are they issued? Walk the reader through from beginning to end with an example of connecting to an LDAP server with a query or an authentication request and show the messages that are passed back to the client (if any). In a discussion of public key encryption, the author states: ""the public key is published for anyone to know, whereas the private key is kept secret from everyone but the user....it doesn't matter who knows your public key, because the public key can't be used to impersonate you."" Please explain this apparent paradox; if I need the public key to decrypt your message, and anyone can have the public key, then how is the data secure? Couldn't anyone tapping into our communication decrypt it if they have the public key too? Including some actual PERL, or JSP, or VB.NET with ASP.NET scripts for connecting to and querying an LDAP server would have been a plus.It is difficult to write a technical book that doesn't merely present a collection of technical facts (which I will take on faith as being accurate). It is important to be able to state the facts plainly and connect them to form a coherent idea. For example: ""A workgroup is just a group of workstations that share a browse list."" I had read volumes about workgroups, workstations and browse lists in other books before finding this concise line (and many more like it) in a book by Mark Minasi. There is nothing for the reader to ponder or second-guess with such a line - it is short and to the point. As is, I didn't find a similar style in this book, nor did I find much information that isn't already freely available on the internet."

Personally I fall into both categories.I like the two-part format with both an explaination of the standards and technology, and then examples of how it was implemented by different vendors. This makes the book widely applicable. I feel the text is quite readable and the examples are clear. It does a good job addressing the how and why questions about LDAP.I highly recommend the book for those getting started with LDAP or wanting to better understand the concepts of something they're already using. For those who are Active Directory admins, I also recommend 'Inside Active Directory' by Kouti from the same publisher. The combination of the two books will give you a strong understanding of how Active Directory works from a directory services perspective.

James Robert Parish's new book ""Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops"" details why. Parish turns his keen eye and strong writing style on how over-paid, egotistical stars, meddling studio execs, directors whose vision has the opaque clarity of a tennis ball, and just plain ""bad-timing"" can sink a strongly anticipated film faster than the Titanic went down. In Fiasco, Parish has chosen fourteen Titanics to muse upon. Yes, Cleopatra, The Cotton Club, Ishtar and Battlefield Earth are included, along with some you may have missed, like The Wild Party - a thorough miss by the usually highly regarded Merchant-Ivory duo - and Shanghai Surprise, another Madonna film crucifixion, accompanied in her writhing agony by then-hubby Sean Penn.Don't misunderstand me; Parish words are written more in sorrow than in anger. He truly loves Hollywood, as his many other books attest. But Parish does not like the film colony's big messes, and he rakes all the partners in these fourteen disasters over the coals for their participation in foisting such abominations off on the public. Good for him! Parish is an excellent writer, and there are juicy tidbits in almost every sentence: lots of behind the scenes drama; warning signs ignored; egos stroked when they should have been squashed. Personally, I've seen all fourteen of these films and I already knew each one was a disaster. Some of them are legendary, so it was hard not to be aware of them. But I never knew the ""back-story"" on any of the films: exactly what made it mis-fire so badly. Viewing most of these films is like arriving at the scene of a murder; you can see the victim, but have no clue as to who committed the murder and what was the motive. Thanks to Parish's Fiasco, you not only discover the murderers - the slaughter of all of these films was assisted by more than one person, rest assured - you also understand their motives, which were misguided in all cases.Another excellent book by James Robert Parish. Fun to read; informative; well-written; and actually a bit sad, given that all the mistakes could have been so easily avoided."

Sulkin,17/19,4.0,1141257600,Why Films Flopped,"Parish does a nice job reviewing and discussing the reasons behind some of Hollywood's big budget flops and disasters. By limiting the scope to movies during the past few decades, only, kicking off with the infamous Cleopatra (the Liz and Dick version), Parish bypasses ill-begotten films from the classic studio days when budgets were less than some of today's music videos.Although some of the films in the book were not outright disasters based on total revenue returns including worldwide grosses and DVDs, they all failed to live up to expectations, excluding the films for which there were never expectations, e.g., Madonna/Penn's Shanghai Gesture. Packaging the Kevin Costner misfires - Waterworld and The Postman - is a nice touch, and I'm sure Parish could have included a few more of Warren Beatty's big budget disappointments, but the behind the scenes goings on for Ishtar and Town and Country are more than sufficient to illustrate the downside of Beatty's total control complex. Parish wisely leaves out such infamous films as Heaven's Gate that are written about in detail elsewhere.Although many of the stories included in the book should be familiar to most film enthusiasts, the overall package should provide more than a few chuckles over the incompetency and infighting associated with the film industry. As William Goldman famously observed about the movies, no one knows anything and this book certainly proves it."

""Heaven's Gate"" was excluded because Bach's ""Final Cut"" had already gone over it, but is a study of follywood's worst really complete without it? The torturous shoot of ""Waterworld"" is only briefly discussed to fit it together with ""The Postman;"" I felt pretty cheated. Yet the book is engagingly written, and what's there is rather dishy. Kevin Costner's laid-back demeanor belies his planet-moving ego; when ""Team America"" was slaughtering celebrities left and right, they should have included him. Watching Robert Evan's dream project ""The Cotton Club"" falling in on itself before his eyes can win your empathy, while the story behind ""Last Action Hero"" reads like a script for a farce ( the movie was thought to be able to give ""Jurassic Park"" stiff box office competition, yet until they were topped by ""Cutthroat Island"" and ""Titanic,"" respectively, the industry's biggest bomb and biggest moneymaker were released within a week of one other). Only ""cleopatra's"" budget is adjusted for inflation, breaking out to the equivilant of 260 million of today's dollars, which is a shame because it could help give perspective of how badly the others fared. But what's there is priceless. The only complaint I could make is that there isn't enough of it. Unlike many of the films here (or any of them, really) this book deserves a sequel."

I eventually realized that what was bugging me was the lack of perspective.Granted, the book does an excellent job of detailing how lack of foresight and attention to detail, combined with the massive egos of the people involved and their disagreements about just what sort of film they were making, caused 14 of these 15 films to become so expensive that they couldn't break even. And it ends with a fascinating list of movies that were ""box-office disappointments in domestic theatrical release""... but the sheer length of this list suggests that such ""disappointments"" are extremely common, while Waterworld, despite going hideously over budget, actually did better than break even.The book does mention in passing that Titanic, which became a huge success both financially and at the Oscars, suffered problems similar to those of Waterworld and Heaven's Gate... but it doesn't give enough details of other films which were similarly plagued but ultimately well-received (many of them made by the same people Fiasco disses). It's easy to recount the failings of films such as Popeye, Shanghai Surprise or Ishtar - I suspect it would much more difficult to explain why enough people went to see films such as Dick Tracy or Basic Instinct that they weren't flops. It would also be more interesting, and more useful.But, as Fiasco quotes William Goldman as saying ""Nobody knows anything, and nobody learns anything."" And while Fiasco is fun to read, I don't think anyone's going to learn very much from it."

But in it's review of some of the worst pictures ever made, he seems to be repeating himself - pictures fail only when they don't bring in the requisite amount of dollars. Everything else is secondary to whether or not the film makes money - and not just a (relatively) small profit. The movies have to make many, many times their cost to not be a failure. That can be a pretty high hurdle.Ultimately, the causes are all the same: lack of studio or producer oversight; inflated star egos; unplanned for (and costly) over-time; bad press and reviews.Some of Hollywood's truly awful films are not reviewed here (""Heaven's Gate"" being the primary example) and some that were arguably fair movies (just not big money makers) are.For example, ""Cleopatra"" is the opening chapter and sets the stage for all that follows. You'll get no argument from me that ""Cleopatra"" was a trial to make. However (in my humble opinion) the final result is a lush tale that fails only in the last third of the picture. Given that, I had to laugh at one contemporary reviewer's comment that ""[Elizabeth Taylor] screeches like a ward heeler's wife at a block party"" in the last half of the film. So true!Mr. Parish also refers to a number of vanity films that are made to promote the liberal political views of the actors involved (""The Chase"", ""The Wild Party"" and ""Reds"" for example) but never explores the possibility that audiences go to movies to be entertained - not lectured to. I know it's currently popular to criticize entertainers for using their platforms to promote their personal political views and I'm not trying to join that band wagon. But it's fair to suggest that a movie made primarily to criticize traditional American mores' is not going to be a big hit with the vast majority of traditional Americans.Each chapter begins with a brief overview of the state of theater going, i.e., attendance numbers, ticket price, etc. and this is interesting in itself. It also contains some few surprises. For example, who knew that the song & dance numbers in ""Ishtar"" were intentionally bad?! I just thought that was a natural by product of the fact that Beatty and Hoffman, while talented actors, are neither singers nor dancers.All-in-all, Mr. Parish's book is an entertaining read and fair accounting of some of the worst films ever made, though he offers little hope that studios, talent or corporate owners have learned anything in the way of lessons from their checkered past. The book is certainly a breath of fresh air from the traditional Tinsel Town history that trumpets silver-screen successes and bypasses its flops."

Of course, its lessons are obvious and because Parish refuses to dig deeper, the best the book has to offer are amusing anecdotes about why a production spiraled out of control and wasn't able to recoup its costs.Even at a brisk three hundred pages with each chapter no more than twenty pages, ""Fiasco"" eventually feels long.

While I would have enjoyed reading about more than 15 entries and I might even quibble with a couple of the choices, there is no doubt that FIASCO makes an enthralling read. The 15 films Parish has chosen for scrutiny (from Cleopatra to Town & Country) are accorded thorough and detailed histories, from the high hopes of pre-production to the critical drubbings of the final products. In addition to being more entertaining than the films themselves, these in-depth investigations illustrate the changes within Hollywood since vertical integration has quashed the more artistic and professional aspects of the mainstream film industry. The Cleopatra, Popeye, and Ishtar chapters are particularly great examples of how talented people got caught up in and overwhelmed by front office conglomerate politics. Perhaps, someday, Parish will write a sequel about some of the many other film flops listed at the back of the book. Surely, they have interesting backstories, too! In the meantime, FIASCO more than satifies."

This wonderful book contains the voice of this great exiled poet as he laments and expresses his personal feelings on his fate, never revealing the ""secret"", but offering us tantalizing clues as if he longs for someone someday to discover the forbidden truth of the Emperor's wrath. These two works, ""Tristia,"" and ""Letters from the Black Sea,"" have been largely ignored through the ages, left standing in the shadows of the famous ""Metamorphoses"" and Ovid's love poems. For those who wish to read the personal poetry, the ""diary,"" of an exiled poet, this book is an absolute treasure. After reading this book, the reader can not help but feel as if he or she has now come to know Ovid on a friendly, intimate level. This book is a must for the serious lover of great literature."

In utilizing this method, the author usually addressed his far away loved ones with soft elegaic poems or epistles intended to be therapeutic to both the sender and recipient. At times, this genre could even take on a sarcastic and vituperative tone. Enemies, rivals, and unfaithful friends or lovers, were commonly exposed to the exiled author's wrath. Some major figures in this tradition were illustrious men like Cicero, Seneca and Boethius. Within the scope of this epoch, Ovid plays no minor role. For the Tristia and the Pontic Epistles influenced many subsequent Latin authors, while continuing to be widely read and highly regarded throughout the Middle Ages. For certain, in the most unanimously favoured book of the Middle Ages, the Consolation of Philosophy, significant traces of Ovidian influence are quite apparent in the prose and poetry portions of Boethius' work. So the overall value of this collection of letters should not be taken lightly. But the high-standing of the Tristia and Ex Ponto within the tradition of Latin literature is not the works only claim to merit. From this volume, we learn much about Ovid's character, while we are left with a sufficient impression about his place of exile. Also, his short autobiography is invaluable: it furnishes much material about his life and family history that otherwise would have been lost. Other historical content will be of use to the historian. For the poet, there are some pointers on how poetry should be written, and there are some helpful first-hand allusions about great poets like Ennius Statius, Virgil, Tibullus and Propertius. The poems themselves are very good and enjoyable to read; the only draw-back to them is the subject-matter, which becomes redundant and almost pathetic if read in large doses. However, this was not a fault, but rather a matter of Ovid's condition. He adjusts his Muse to fit his situation. In exile, he writes consolatory poems. Ovid himself points this out many times in these epistles. This volume is highly recommended. The Tristia and the Pontic Epistles will help students of the liberal studies cultivate many virtues of character, taste, and literary style, which will later prove to be beneficial to all facets of society."

The general consensus has been that while Ovid's style and technical prowess are as brilliant as ever in these late works, they suffer from monotonous and depressing subject matter. Ovid complains about the cold and the barbarity of his surroundings, bemoans his fate, and makes abject and fulsome pleas for leniency to the princeps.Such a view, in my opinion, disserves Ovid, particularly in light of his demonstrated talent and wit in the rest of his work. In the midst of a truly touching description of his last night in Rome, when describing the farewells of his household, he exclaims that he has (or wishes he had -- the Latin is ambiguous) ""hearts joined with the faith of Theseus."" (I.iii.66). While the reference is most obviously to the friendship of Theseus and Pirithous, it is not possible that the author of the Heroides would be unaware of the other loyalty associated with Theseus: his faithlessness to Ariadne. Thus the moving scene of Ovid's parting with his devoted wife takes on a darker irony in addition to its apparent emotional quality.Similarly, Ovid's often embarrassingly overdone protestations of Augustus' greatness and mercy cannot be read completely unironically. Even the arguments ostensibly addressed directly to Caesar should not be seen as entirely earnest personal pleas. These are not private letters, or legal arguments, and there is no reason to think that they were even sent directly to be read by Augustus. Ovid was writing for a wider audience of intellectuals in Rome, among whom figured speech was expected and valued much more than direct statement. Just because Ovid claims to have lost his inspiriation and wit in his despondancy does not mean that we are supposed to read him at his word in this or in anything else. With this understanding, Ovid's poems from the edge of civilization are revealed to be clever, even humorous, and diverting in spite of their monothematic and tragic cast."

His unadorned prose elucidates any topic, including some obscure ones (geology, a career as a merchant marine sailor), and does so without either boring or bashing the reader. He is simply a great prose stylist. The Headmaster is a very early book, about the man who ruled the prep school McPhee attended with a gentle iron hand for 66 years. Although only 40 years old, the world McPhee describes and The Headmaster himself, Frank Boyden, feel as remote as a Bronte heroine. I, for one, think we could use more of that world in this one. Perhaps the most memorable moment in The Headmaster (originally a long New Yorker article) is McPhee's image of the more than 80 year old headmaster out in a chilling night rain, walking the football field of his beloved school alone and replacing by hand the divots dug up by players in the day's game. It is an unforgettable prose snapshot and McPhee delivers it without frills. That ability to recognize the telling moment and let it speak for itself makes McPhee the wonderful writer he is.After this introduction I recommend Levels of the Game (a chronicle of a US Open tennis final), Coming Into the Country (Alaska) and Looking for a Ship (merchant marine). They will only whet your appetite."

This was in the late 1980's. It spoke to me. I have no connection with Deerfield Academy other than having read the storyof Frank Boyden. Yet, somehow his story has prepared me for a major task: saving a &quot;boot camp&quot; for young juvenile offenders here in Wisconsin, where I live. The Youth Leadership Training Center is not a college prep school; it is a prep school for life. It is sobering to know that since 1996, four of its graduate have died from street violence. Nonetheless, as Boyden had a vision for Deerfield, even so I have one for the Center as I set about saving it from closing, as did Boyden for Deerfield Academy. If I can mean to my boys what he has meant to his boys, I will have led a successful life. His story tells me that today (5-7-01) I can climb the same mountains that Boyden did, meet the same challenges, and secure the same outcomes -- teaching young men what they need to know to grow up to be fully functioning men. It is funny, but when this book &quot;spoke to me&quot; I had no idea its story was planting a seed that now will take root in Wisconsin in a setting at the opposite end of the socio-economic spectrum. Yet, college prep or reform school, all of it is about the human spirit. As I set about keeping the &quot;boot camp&quot; alive in the face of state bureaucratic opposition, I will keep the example of Frank Boyden in front of me -- and we shall win and write another story about another school and another Headmaster.

Boyden of Deerfield,,A1EXB9QS2DOSZB,Sven Allenbach-Schmidt,24/24,5.0,1010448000,A Teacher for the generations,"From 1902 to 1968, Frank Boyden was the Headmaster of Deerfield, a private boy's school in the countryside of Massachusetts. When Boyden arrived, the school had 14 students, transportation was by foot or horse drawn wagon, and he intended to stay only long enough to get enough money. 66 years later, Deerfield was one of the leading prep schools in America, the equal to Exeter and Andover. Best of all, the school wasn't an imitation of British schools, as so many prep schools of the first half of the 20th century were. Boyden had turned Deerfield into an outstanding educational institution while keeping it uniquely American. Demanding, even a bit of a despot, Boyden shaped the school and its students into something special, a school where the students come first, then the faculty.Only John McPhee could tell the story as it deserves. Boyden and all the other residents of Deerfield come alive under McPhee's pen. The little touches, like the Headmaster's rejuvenating midday naps, followed by letter writing and inspections tours, make it seem as if the reader is there.I doubt you'll be able to read this book, and not wish you could have been a student under Boyden. For several generations, Deerfield under his leadership was what a school should be."

Not long afterward, I had the privilege as well as pleasure of visiting Deerfield Academy and was given a tour of it by its headmaster, Frank Boyden. At that time, I was a Master of English at Kent School (Kent, CT). I recently re-read this book and another of John McPhee's, A Sense of Where You Are. The title of the latter work correctly describes Boyden's total understanding of his relationship with a once tiny school (founded in 1797) located in what remains a rustic village. Throughout his years as headmaster (1902-1968), he knew exactly where he was as well as where exactly he wanted Deerfield to be (and remain) under his leadership. Just as Mr. Boyden gave me a tour of Deerfield Academy during my visit so many years ago, McPhee enables his reader to take a comprehensive ""tour"" of the unique and compelling relationship between a remarkable educator and the school community he headed for 66 years.Of special interest to me is what McPhee reveals about Boyden's style of leadership (autocratic but compassionate) and his obsession with maintaining ""proper"" appearances (e.g. manicured grounds, only the very best athletic equipment, the most impressive-looking athletes first off the bus). With regard to his relationships with faculty members, ""The more you cooperate with the headmaster, the more he imposes on you,"" according to a teacher who had been at Deerfield for 25 years. ""He expects a fantastic commitment. If you give it, he expects more. If you don't give it, he carries you, but you don't exist.""As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I also found many valuable lessons to be learned from Boyden's relationships with Deerfield's students. For example, his emphasis on courtesy in athletics. ""No matter how able a Deerfield player was or how close a game had become, if he showed anger he was benched."" For Boyden, athletic competition must demonstrate ""a moral force."" He played on Deerfield teams until he was about 35, and was head coach of football, basketball, and baseball until he was nearly 80. He loved sports. He often observed that ""it's better to lose in a sportsmanlike way than to win and gloat over it."" Point made, he would then add, ""Now, boys, let's not let up on [the given opponent] for a minute. Let's win this one, if possible, by forty points."" Frank Boyden had a sense of where he was as well as of where everyone else associated with Deerfield Academy should always be. The values to which he dedicated his life often require personal sacrifices which -- apparently -- many parents, educators, and young people today are unwilling and/or unable to make."

Found most often in schools where strong headmasters have either founded the school or contributed a life of service, Deerfield Academy comes across in McPhee's work as the true child of Boyden whose various quirks in no way detracted from his personal mission of making a difference in boys' lives.

Boyden's unfailing optimism in the face of tremendous obstacles will inspire aspiring educational leaders.As an administrator in a small college I find that much of Boyden's philosophy of education is appropriate for educators in any setting.

Then tell him to go find out more from an unimpeachable source: John McPhee, Deerfield Class of 1949, author of the 1966 classic, The Headmaster.Boyden arrived in solitary Deerfield in 1902 at age 21. A fresh graduate of Amherst, he came to take over a tiny public school of 14 boys and girls. He thought he would stay a year and then go to law school. Over 60 years later, in 1966, The Headmaster, now aged 86, was still in charge. And Deerfield was thriving. His school has risen from insignificance to the lofty heights of elite boarding school prestige. He built a unique institution.How unique? In 1924 Deerfield was near financial collapse, despite the Headmaster's all-present efforts. Knowing the intrinsic worth of Deerfield that The Headmaster had created, his colleague headmasters from rivals Exeter, Taft and Andover left their schools and went to New York to raise money from their own alumni to save Deerfield!McPhee tells the whole story of a uniquely whole Headmaster. No detail was small enough for Boyden. He taught classes, coached sports, even as headmaster played on the sports teams. He recruited local farm boys, riding into the countryside in a horse and buggy to meet them. He worked the telephone switchboard. He kept his desk in the main hallway. He was everywhere in every way, mostly as the quiet if omni-present moral force for his boys. The school had no fancy brochures, no vast policy tomes. He ran the school intuitively. As a mentor, manager and molder of boys, The Headmaster was the master.Now is a different time and place. Boarding schools now are more like colleges, with their vast endowments, five-star facilities, and overwrought faculties of Ph.D.'s. They are mostly wonderful institutions. But they all wish they could recreate that special essence of the intensely personal touch and soulful embrace of the likes of Frank Boyden, a titan in the pantheon of headmasters."

Instead of the standard Joe Bob treatment (breast counts, number of car crashes and/or severed limbs), he gives us an extremely informative and genuinely affectionate take on some of the most influential underground movies to ever offend delicate, G-rated sensibilities. Some of the flicks covered are even respectable (but no less offensive)-- the chapter on ""Crash"" is one of my favorites. Maybe fans who will accept absolutely NOTHING from John Bloom except his Joe Bob alter ego won't like it because of its lack of redneck element, but for fans (and cult film lovers) who appreciate the fact that behind Joe Bob there is a rather more intellectual and subtle mind, this is a great read."

Readers used to Joe Bob's comic persona may initially be put off by this difference in tone, but if they will stick with this book, they will experience a very satisfying set of essays of analysis and history about these films. These essays are very funny in a different, more irony-laced sort of way, in their own right. And what films they are! Some of them still couldn't be shown on network television after all these years.Briggs/Bloom skillfully gathers together the pertinent, fascinating facts on each movie and gives his own perspective as well. I have never seen Cronenberg's ""Crash"" because of its somewhat perverted, NC-17 rated reputation. Joe Bob's persuasive essay on why it really is a fine film makes me want to seek it out and see it. The same can't be said for ""Deep Throat"" and ""Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS"", but he make me see why some people would be attracted to these dangerous films. Essays on ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Exorcist"", and ""The Wild Bunch"" are nostalgic for the 1970's and what seems like the last era American movies were truly adventerous and independent.Many observers have noted that Briggs/Bloom has written criticism for the conservative magazine ""National Review"", and that sort of tough realism about sex and violence carries over into this book. Politically correct liberal puritans would be shocked and appalled by most of these films. (In the essay on ""Resevoir Dogs"", Joe Bob chortles about how that film changed the image of the initially granola-ish, overly earnest Sundance Film Festival.) This book is a celebration of the freedom we have in America to appreciate art that is made from the most unlikely material. ""Mom and Dad"" and ""Shaft"" can teach us more about our great, weird old American culture than a thousand pious textbooks."

While his commentary often involved parody and satire of the purportedly high-brow discourse of movie critics like Roger Ebert, genuine information and thoughtful criticism could always be found carefully embedded in the shtick.With PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING: SHOCKING MOVIES THAT CHANGED HISTORY!, author Joe Bob discusses the history, social relevance, and lasting influence of 15 (not 20, as claimed by the blurb from Publishers Weekly) films that, at the time when each was originally released, caused some sort of uproar or scandal in the media, the arena of public opinion, and sometimes even the U.S. courts. The films included here touch on nearly every major cinematic genre, from westerns to horror to hard-core porn, so fans and film students of all types should find something of interest on these pages. Joe Bob's usual wry sense of humor is clearly in evidence throughout the text, but his overall style here involves less of the redneck shtick and more of the history and literate criticism, and the result is an outstanding read that is both entertaining and highly informative.As mentioned above, the group of films that Joe Bob analyzes here does include examples from across the genre spectrum, but the list is clearly weighted towards the horror genre. So PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING: SHOCKING MOVIES THAT CHANGED HISTORY! will be of particular interest to horror fans, with the chapters on William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (1973) and Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974) offering an exceptional history and criticism of those works. Considering the book's emphasis on horror, however, it is puzzling as to why Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD is only mentioned in passing and does not get a chapter of its own, especially since Raimi has gone on to become a mainstream Hollywood insider. But that omission is only a minor oversight in this otherwise excellent collection of essays.Any ardent fan of cinema or serious student of film should be familiar with critic Joe Bob Briggs, as his humorous approach to film analysis is both a refreshing and profound alternative to the bombastic diatribe of mainstream film criticism. And if those fans and film students want to truly understand why some of cinema's most controversial films have also become some of the most influential, they should immediately add PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING: SHOCKING MOVIES THAT CHANGED HISTORY! to the top of their required-reading list."

Martin ""Jeff Punk Rock Martin""",1/1,5.0,1218067200,High Art and Glorious Dreck,"It may be Joe Bob's name on the cover, but ""Profoundly Disturbing"" is much more the work of the more schooled, less outrageous John Bloom. (For those not familiar, John Bloom is to Joe Bob what Bruce Wayne is to Batman.) This is no complaint, for it's a pleasure to see films that surely appeal to Joe Bob - everything from the roadshow classic ""Mom and Dad"" to the exploitation-as-art hit ""Reservoir Dogs"" - get the scholarly treatment by someone as thoughtful and well-versed in film as Bloom. Not only is ""Profoundly Disturbing"" a fun, informative read, but it achieves, perhaps, the two highest goals an author might have in writing about movies. First, it makes you want to take another look at some films you've already seen. And second, it makes you want to see the films it covers which you've missed.So, you thought ""Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS"" was merely exploitation? Well, maybe you're right but, as Bloom/Briggs makes clear, it still occupies a place in film history that's worthy of discussion. Combining the mind of a scholar with the heart of a gorehound, the author manages to connect the dots between high art and lowbrow schlock in tidy fashion. How many other critics, after all, will devote the same amount of thought, research, brainpower and ink to, say, ""Blood Feast"" as they do to ""And God Created Woman"" in the same book? Or even in the same lifetime?There are great essays here on some shocking, revolutionary, sometimes even distasteful films. Standouts include Joe Bob's takes on ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Deep Throat"" and the aforementioned ""Reservoir Dogs."" Along with reporting plenty of hard facts, Joe Bob works in some eye-opening observation. In the volumes that have been written on ""Deep Throat"" for instance, the author may be the first to make the uber-simple point that this was really nothing more than ""a down-and-dirty stag film shot in ratty motel rooms."" The only thing remarkable about it at all is that it somehow crawled out of the Pussycat Theater scene and into mainstream consciousness.In fact, this phenomenon of busting out of the low expectations of genre-fueled filmmaking is one theme that ties these films together. Nearly every flick in this book was a box office overachiever, earning well beyond the norm for porn, gore, horror, etc. The other theme that connects these films is this: each one, on some level, is an exploitation movie. Whether intentionally or incidentally, each depended upon shock value to up the ante at the box office. Sure, ""The Exorcist"" is an artful meditation on the nature of faith, good and evil. But such philosophical musings do not butts in seats put. ""The Exorcist"" was a hit because it showed a little girl projectile barfing and doing a 360 with her head.Hats off to Briggs/Bloom, then, for giving the full historical/critical treatment to movies that most writers would rather pretend didn't exist. In an age in which critics are so quick to tell us that ham-fisted muck like ""The Contender"" and even ""Wall-E"" are `smart' simply because the hit a trendy political note, Joe Bob is one of a very few unrestrained by the stifling limits of acceptable taste and political correctness. God bless Joe Bob Briggs and all the twisted souls who made these films."

Hyperbolically subtitled ""Shocking Movies That Changed History,"" Briggs covers fifteen films that made a significant dent in the side panels of cinema. Presented in chronological order, the book chronicles cinematic mavericks from THE CABINET OF DOCTOR CALIGARI to CRASH.While the chapters on THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE EXORCIST may feel a little light, Briggs delves deep into MOM & DAD, AND GOD CREATED WOMEN, and THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Standout reviews include BLOOD FEAST, SHAFT, and RESERVOIR DOGS. Always close to my heart, Briggs's take on RESERVOIR DOGS managed to be fresh, giving equal time to both the film's production and the ire raised by its controversial director. After having read everything on the film that I could lay my sweaty paws on, that Briggs managed to break new ground for me is quite a feat.Briggs gives even the schlockiest film the respect it deserves while keeping his wit razor sharp. His mix of levity and earnestness is always a welcome contrast to the dour self-serious cineastes that glut the bookshelves."

With the typical Briggsian style, his comfortable and at times delightful prose makes tackling the epic and archetypal subjects in these films manageable for anyone. Especially intriguing is the full scope of information in which Briggs submerges us to see not only the final product of each film, but also the genesis and ramifications of each. I haven't viewed several of the films highlighted in the book, but after Briggs' astute exploration of what I had considered some of the most taboo of movies, I feel compelled to further my education by renting many of them.

(Fortunately, amazon has discounted it.) When did paperbacks start costing $24.95? Especially one by Joe Bob Briggs - has he abandoned his working-class supporters? His earlier paperbacks were less than $10; even hardcover editions of Cosmic Wisdom and Iron Joe Bob weren't $20. Why is this book's price so high?A look inside shows where some of the cash goes. Glossy pages that reflect the light's glare make it hard to find a comfortable reading position. The text is split into two columns, divided and almost surrounded by red borders. Little red movie-related symbols cross the top of each page. Why the obsession with red? Has Joe Bob gone Communist on us? Movie posters introduce each chapter. And some awful fonts are chosen for the first paragraph of, and various statements from, each chapter. In short, style trumps substance. Why does Joe Bob require special effects? He IS a special effect.Well, he was. Here, he makes his case for the movies that most influenced public tastes and later film making, some of which are known more for promotional antics than artistic merits. He discusses how the idea for each movie originated, summarizes the plots (revealing each ending so that if you've never seen the films, you'll not be interested now), attempts to interpret those movies that make no sense, tells why he thinks the movie is important, and goes over the careers of the key actors, directors and/or writers involved, scattering trivia throughout. At the end of each chapter, a guide covers related movies, often repeating information from the chapter.While competent, the writing rarely rises above standard research reporting, and often failed to maintain my interest. For example, I took 3 breaks while reading about And God Created Woman. Why would any red-blooded American man make Brigette Bardot boring?In his Reservoir Dogs chapter, Joe Bob condones plagiarism. Does it follow that he steals from other writers? If so, who? I thought his style and outlook were unique, but if not, I'd like to read what his victims wrote. Citing sources is common courtesy: copying for profit or glory is theft.For the money, too much is missing from this book - say, about 150 pages. The index is incomplete. It lists only movies, ignoring all of the people involved, as well as the innovations introduced.Maybe Joe Bob felt that his coverage of Deep Throat was getting (ahem) long, but he fails to note that Linda Lovelace's nipples are never shown in the movie. He doesn't explain the 1969 Naked Came the Stranger hoax. He claims that, other than Linda, Carol Conners and Harry Reems, Throat actors had no later roles: he completely overlooks Dolly Sharp, who, as Gloria Leonard, appeared in several X-rated movies through the 1970s, including one that he mentions, The Opening of Misty Beethoven. (She also published the glossy adult magazine High Society, and hosted an adult cable TV show in New York City.) Deep Throat was probably Gloria's best performance, though; she subsequently refused any on-screen anal scenes. Now that's disturbing!Joe Bob asserts that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre introduced the chain saw as a weapon. Not so - it was used a year earlier in Last House on the Left (granted, in self-defense). He notes Saw's influence on metal bands, but neglects its effects on punk: Johnny Rotten enjoyed the movie, and the first Ramones album includes a song about it.Several more movies could have added bulk to this book, including The Birth of a Nation (1915), Birth Control and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (both 1917), Triumph of the Will (1935), M (1951, or the 1932 German version), Night of the Living Dead (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), Carrie (1976 - Joe Bob mentions a 1977 movie called Ruby, also featuring Piper Laurie, which reads like a Carrie rip-off), Caligula (1980), and Basket Case (1982). Night of the Living Dead was mentioned in early promotions of this book, but that chapter must have been cut.The most glaring omission, though, is Joe Bob himself. After he temporarily quit writing in 1997, he seemed to have undergone a humor removal operation. Where is the social commentary laced with his acerbic wit? Where are such characters as Bobo Rodriguez, Cherry Dilday, and Rhett Beavers? Where is his uncommon wisdom, so desperately needed in this country? Apparently, they're all in his distant past. H. L. Mencken estimated that a good writer has about 10 years of worthwhile work before he burns out. Perhaps, then, we're lucky that Joe Bob provided a solid 15 years of refreshing, opinionated literature. His writing used to provoke my delightfully shocked reaction, ""Did he just SAY that?"" Throughout Disturbing, I kept wondering, ""Why am I still reading this?""Film scholars might find this book interesting. To me, Profoundly Disturbing is primarily disappointing."
0789308444,Profoundly Disturbing: The Shocking Movies that Changed History,,A3T7MC28NFTYCH,"Randall Ivey ""Randall""",5/12,3.0,1085961600,Fun...but not Profound,"Joe Bob Briggs is almost as much fun on the printed page as he is on television, so I opened PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING with great anticipation and closed it with some disappointment.First of all Briggs' choice of profoundly disturbing movies, while hard to refute, is awfully short and awfully familiar. How many more essays on CALIGARI or DEEP THROAT or CHAINSAW MASSACRE do we really need? It would have been fascinating if Joe Bob had plucked less discussed movies out of the disturbing movie cesspool and given them some attention. For instance, instead of highlighting SHAFT for its role in blaxploitation, why not discuss the obscure black-cast horror flick GANJA AND HESS? Instead of DEEP THROAT, why not Gerard Damiano's second hit, and much greater and much more disturbing movie, DEVIL IN MISS JONES, or Radley Metzger's THE OPENING OF MISTY BEETHOVEN, still considered by many the best porn flick ever made. Why not HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER instead of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE? Perhaps Briggs's editor, or Briggs himself, for that matter, just wanted to play it safe, as though commerical appeal might be compromised if he had chosen some really offbeat artifact from the movie netherworld.Not that I didn't learn something from the book. It abounds in interesting tidbits. For instance, I had no idea Gary Sinise's daddy was a crew member on Herschell Gordon Lewis's BLOOD FEAST. But there isn't enough arcania of that sort or enough original insights about the movies to make it anything outstanding. Usually Joe Bob summarizes the movie's plot, gives some background on its production, and makes mention of its impact then moves on. In his treatment of ILYSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS, he forgets the movie altogether for several pages to give the reader a chronicle of the Ilse Koch, the real life paradigm for Ilysa. It gets tiresome after a while. And his consideration of Cronenberg's CRASH gets downright incoherent as he attempts to make some &quot;profound&quot; statement about the movie's content. Sorry, Joe Bob, but I didn't buy it for a minute.Still, this is a very attractive volume and easy to read for the most part and probably a must for any hardcore cult movie completist."

Joe Bob used to be an original, creative writer. His early work, with his witty observations and total lack of Political Correctness, always left me in awe of his talent. This one however, is just lame.For starters, this selection of movies have been discussed and written about so many times now that if the reader doesn't know their history and significance by now he should just quit watching anything other than the standard Hollywood drivel. It's amazing how he has managed to take movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS and make them sound so dry and bland. I actually had to fight off sleep while reading much of this book. Is this the Joe Bob we all knew and loved?It makes one wonder if maybe he was getting paid by the word. Much of it comes across as some wanna-be writer trying hard to impress you with just how smart and intelligent he can be (like the kid in class no one liked except the teacher - and that was a pity thing).So what's up Joe Bob?

It is about the ""blasphemous"" concept of merging sex with religion. Why this is controversial is because the Christian church teaches sex for any other purpose than procreation is sinful and all sinners of course go to hell. Well now that I've almost gotten Christianity completely out of my life I'm not scared of the thought that I could very possibly go to hell and rot for all eternity nor do I fear that I will not go to heaven. Christianity is gradually losing its stranglehold on American society and I've been a practicing occultist long enough where the ""shocking nature"" alegedly of the book's contents just seemed like typical Crowleyesque teachings. I credit Duquette and Hyatt with much needed originality in the field of occult literature and also give thanks to Crowley for having an almost unending depth to his own teachings and character. Get this book if you've seen almost everything to the point where nothing really shocks you and you want an original book on esoteric subject matter. I tried other forms of the occult and the Satanism of Anton LaVey was too stuck in Christianity to the point where they almost pigeonholed themselves into the belief system to the point where after all was said and done Satanism was just another religion. Wicca/Witchcraft were actually the same thing and a really bad watered down ripoff of Aleister Crowley and with almost all Wicca 101 books being basically the same as well as more obscure stuff like candle magick it was all the same too. I like the originality of Crowleyesque literature while at the same time being almost stereotypical/cliche but also disturbing. Crowley, etc. didn't act like everything was such a big deal unlike Satanism."

It's early translations in the 400s in China became a whole school of interpretation unique to it, albeit it was replaced as the most popular Mahayana Sutra in China. This was a unique take and not necessarily proportional to what was in the minds of the people who made up the contributors to the Sanskrit text. Then there is the Lankavatara sutra as was seized on by its transit through Tibet where it was translated in the Imperial Era of the 800s, but in Tibet's medieval era became a spiritual-political football in the struggle between those who analyzed the Emptiness teachings and Yogacara teachings as being the second and third turning of the wheel of the Dharma, and then argued about which was the provisional truth and which was the definitive truth. The this wonderful sutra actually stands outside of this argument and stands on its own 2 feet. It is this third voice, the voice of the Lankavatara sutra that this author tries to bring out like a lawyer speaking for the text as if the text were someone on trial in the court of law.It is time for this intelligent and erudite defense because now, 30 years after the text was translated by DT Suzuki, the decades have helped put many issues in perspective thanks to modern scholarship. We can actually hear the voice of the Sutra of above the roar of its traditional proponents of every school and camp.Reference here is made to modern philosophy but what is borrowed is explained. Unlike some authors he does not try to translate Buddhism into some modern formal philosophical language.It is interesting to see that this text, like many Mahayana Sutras, is actually a little library of collected smaller texts and sayings and he does a wonderful job of marshaling quotes from the book into a form less random than the looseleaf recipe-book collage of the actual text. This is one of those few modern academic texts on Buddhism is not only done in a clear voice that modern laypeople could understand, but it is talking about a subject in such a way as that one's own practice and understanding of Buddhism is deepened."

But even among lawyers, there are the elites, and the elites within the elite. Of the half-million practicing law in the early 1980s, James B. Stewart tells us, only 3,000 work in the blue-chip corporate law firms ""which occupy the pinnacle of the profession.""These men (women for the most part came later) were set apart by their education (Ivy was good, Harvard Law better), achievement (law review editor also a plus), and sheer dedication.In the best of the eight essays which make up the book, we meet attorneys at the firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, who are representing IBM in an anti-trust case and happen to be Stewart's own old firm. Working through weekends and vacations is small beer to these guys, as Stewart writes: ""When Sahid scored another triumph by billing 24 hours in a single day, Rolfe - in a move that became the subject of legend in the firm - flew to California, worked on the plane and, by virtue of the change in time zones, managed to bill 27 hours in one day.""Forget about getting home early to pick up your kids. Divorce was a common casualty, and a certain casual cruelty prevailed, unusually harsh even for the American workplace. One of the more easygoing partners at Cravath counsels an associate: ""You tell people their work isn't good, even if it's perfect. Find something and make them redo it, or they'll give you anything.""This is hog heaven for any John Grisham enthusiast. The rest of ""The Partners"" isn't nearly so entertaining. But it's a very illuminating look into the world of high-pressure corporate law in all its varied facets, like public offerings, hostile takeovers, government bailouts, even estate planning. I felt I learned a lot reading each one of the essays, even if it was sometimes work keeping awake, especially as Stewart likes to show off his technical aptitude now and again.At times, this has the feeling of a college textbook. There's an opening chapter which features efforts by the legal community to help liberate the U.S. embassy personnel held against their will in Iran from 1979-1981, where Stewart seems to forget that the lawyers' work had nothing to do with the hostages' liberation. He also writes up the Chrysler bailout saga from a legal standpoint, then at the end sheepishly admits it was really a political issue at the end. The writing is often dry, and this book is a product of another era almost a whole generation gone by.But Stewart knows what he writes about, and you will feel the vigor of the law as practiced at its highest level. You may not know these cases from reading about them in the news, media reporting on business law is pretty spotty unless it's Enron. But as Stewart makes clear, in writing about what could have happened if IBM had been broken up by the government, that ""the government antitrust case is as close as litigation ever comes to social and economic planning.""In other words, these cases may well decide more about the quality and value of the lives we live here in America than does any single presidential election. So it's nice to have a learned explainer like Stewart to put it all down for you. He has gone on to more-heralded things as a writer since this, his first book, but he was off to a fine start."

A great plot of 1980's destruction that's as timeless as the migrant story in Grapes of Wrath. The narrative sings between two locales -- New York City and a tiny (vanishing) farm town in Kansas.

I read this book shortly before I moved to NYC, and it gave me some insight into the city I now call home.

He covers the waterfront - the demise of the family farm,the real estate boom in New York City and the resulting rise of a new class of dispossessed - the homeless. The plot revolves around the narrator and his two brothers - one a journalist, the other an ambitious real estate mogul - and their grieving wastrel of an alcoholic father.

In the line of great American realism--Ford and Steinbeck come most immediately to mind--it tells the story of three brothers who make their way out of Kansas and into New York in the late-1980's.Owing to the author's deft handiwork, the tale carries significant thematic heft-the demise of the middle class, the draining of the prairie, the flow of human and inhuman capital into the megalopolis--without us even noticing.

Author asks you to do a review and make sure you know all the previous material before attempting musical sight reading exercises. The second part of the book covers the more complex notation found in the classical pieces. It is more fast paced because the author assumes that a reader has accumulated the knowledge from the first part. At the end, there are: a directory of musical signs, a directory of all notes on the piano and guitar, and a short musical dictionary. Very handy reference.Are there better books on the topic? I do not know. I'm not an expert. In my opinion the book does what it advertises. You'll certainly learn how to read the music. Price is really acceptable.

I had been playing the keyboard/piano for years (learning songs by ear and making my own compositions) before I decided that I wanted to give a shot at learning how to read sheet music. Back in '04, this was the first book I got on music notation. The statement on the outside cover about ""challenging exercises"" is right! This book jumps right in to assuming that the learner will want to spend time pouring over each exercise repeatedly for extended lengths of time before moving onto the next one, without offering assistance in the way of memorization techniques. For instance, in one of the early sections, the author states: ""As long as you can remember the name of ONE note, you can work out all the others."" This isn't much help, being that the book introduces nearly all the notes at once, in rapid succession; first the ones on the staff, then all the notes above and below the staffs! The only song learned in between is a brief version of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"". Not even E-G-B-D-F (Every Good Boy Does Fine) and G-B-D-F-A (Great Big Dogs Fight Animals) are thrown in as helpful mnemonics for the treble and bass cleff!Plus, this book only includes eleven practice songs! While covering a myriad of complex areas, there is little chance to practice and whole lot of imformation to memorize for a complete beginner. The attitude of this book is comparable to the situation where you ask someone how to draw something, and they say ""Oh, it's easy, you just do this..."" and then proceed draw a masterpiece from scratch without telling you anything about method or technique! While claiming that it is ""fundamentals of music notation made easy"", Evans' book really presents the material in a way which is more frustrating than enlightening.I had given up on learning how to read sheet music for awhile, until I came acrossAdult All-In-One Course: Lesson-Theory-Technic : Level 1 (Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course), which is fantastic. Unlike Roger Evan's book, I was able to progress through a new section and song every few days in Alfred's, and it took me about 3 1/2 months to finish. There are two other levels in the course that I plan on moving onto, since I can now play all the songs in that book, a few songs in other sheet music books I've gotten, and I have a pretty good understanding of the principals that the book covers (what key a song is in, chords, etc.).However, I should note that I have actually used Evans' as a reference on occasion For being such a pretentious book, its 'Directory of Musical Signs', 'Note Directory', and 'Short Musical Dictionary' are definitely useful for clarifying certain terms and notes. But, helpful in learning how to actually read music for the first time? Not for me!"

It was also interesting that the shop owner's sister did the illustrations in the book. The book was not for sale in the shop, but I looked on Amazon, and was happy to find the book right away.The book itself is written from interviews with mostly elderly residents from the area, and interspersed with historical references regarding the origins of the customs. On some levels it is a little simplistic, but still interesting if for nothing else, for nostalgic reasons. The illustrations remind me of primitive artwork, which fits the style of the book. I would not call this a definitive work on the subject of Christmas customs in the mountains of Virginia, but it is still interesting to hear the accounts of the people interviewed.I was happy to find this book so easily on Amazon, and was pleased with the service provided by the carrier."

0821759825,"Blue Heaven, Black Night",,A2OI1UXCPO6DEP,Tina,22/24,2.0,949017600,Too Stressful,"Boy was I disappointed! After reading &quot;Beneath a Blood Red Moon&quot; I thought I'd found a new author to collect. WRONG. I might read another of her books just to see if this one was a fluke, but I'm liable to be gun shy for a few months.This book was one stress after another. It was one of those overdone story lines in which the heroine obstinately refuses to accept the fact that she has feelings for the hero. In fact, she's nice to everyone but him. By the time she begins to come around (and this is three quarters of the way to the end of a 500 and some odd paged novel), the hero goes off to the crusades.After she FINALLY accepts the fact that she loves her husband, she goes to the holyland to try to find him. In the mean time, he's &quot;slaked his lust&quot; with another woman, even though he thought of his wife the whole time. (Pleeeez!)When she gets to the holyland, she is then abducted by an Arabian prince, thereby setting off an entire new set of stressors.I feel that the author was trying to use all of this friction as sexual tension, but she missed her target completely. Unless you like inflaming your ulcer, chances are you will find this book stressful instead of sexually and romantically intense.All of this was stress was then woven throughout an incredibly slow-paced book with way too much historical detail. I'd go sit in a history class if I wanted a dissertation on medieval life.Perhaps it's just me, but when I read a romance, I want to feel good the whole way through. Reality provides enough emotional rollercoasters. I give this two stars only because it was well-written. Otherwise, this is a big thumbs down."

She writes with passion and great talent that brings alive the time of knights and their ladies and simply sweeps you away. This one is, in my opinion, right up there with Princess of Fire and Knight of Fire, two others I've given 5 stars to (see my other reviews). First, there is the legend of the Plantagenets, the story of a beautiful woman with blue green eyes and red gold hair, Melusine, who fire could not burn, and of the knight who takes her as a spoils of war to find he is mesmerized by her beauty and craves her love. He becomes obsessed with her. But when he tries to test her, she disappears into thin air, leaving him with their two children whose heirs are Henry II and Richard the Lion Heart. So begins the complex story of Sir Bryan Stede, a knight who rose from humble beginnings to become the favored knight of Henry II and then his son, Richard the Lion Heart. Set in the late 12th century, Stede rises in reputation to earn the respect of his king's enemies, like Saladin, who Richard fights for Jerusalem in the the 3rd crusade in the Holy Land. In a case of mistake, Bryan captures Henry's illegitimate daughter, Elise, Duches of Montoui in France believing her to be a thief. She fights him and lies to him. In his anger, he takes her believing she is no innocent and then he becomes obsessed with her. But each is promised to another. At the point when they both hated each other, I couldn't see how Drake could bring them together, but she did and it was masterful. The story leads to the Holy Land and to an Arabian prince, Jalahar, who fights Bryan. Once he sees Elise he also becomes obsessed with her and will not give her up after he captures her. What a story!! I do recommend you read ""the legend"" intro twice so as not to forget it as it gives clues to the rest. If you're a Shannon Drake fan, this is one you'll want to read again."

The tape has two sides -- one is audible voice hypnosis and the other is subliminal (with the sound of waves). I have no idea if subliminal tapes really work. However, the hypnosis side of the tape is excellent. His imagery is relaxing and soothing. The tape is longer than most because he seeks to heal your body in various ways from various sources. He is careful to focus, also, on the reasons for physical illness such as fear, resentment, and anger and to use hypnotic suggestion to release those negative feelings so that you can get better. I'm so impressed with his book that I'm ordering another. Don't hesistate."

You must admit that it is a little interesting. So, I read it and now I feel that there is a whole side of Hollywood (aka, La-La Land) that people don't often know about. The book goes into a lot of the action behind the scenes of life in Hollywood. Being from the east coast, it was a new point of view with which to look at the lives of Californians. I can't say that I really liked the book, but the story was definitely one that had promise. The characters were moderately well-developed and there were enough surprises to keep me reading.

It does not feature Hercule Poirot but instead introduces Tommy and Tuppence. The pair are childhood friends who went their separate ways during WWI and chance into each other in postwar London. Both are trying to find jobs and are, like most of the other returning veterans, not having much success. They hit on a plan to become 'adventurers' and soon find themselves caught up in a chain of events that had begun years before with the sinking of the Luisitania. The plot is wildly fantastic involving international conspiracies, secret agents seeking secret documents, American millionaires and romance.This is one of Christie's 'master criminal' stories, very much in the same vein as THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT and THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY among others. If you enjoyed these or are a P. G. Wodehouse fan you'll love this one but if you are looking for a challenging or more realistic mystery look elsewhere."

Young and rather foolish, Tommy and Tuppence offer themselves as paid adventurers to the general public. &quot;No unreasonable offer refused,&quot; their ad claims. When someone actually takes Tuppence up on the advertisement, the duo find themselves in the midst of a mystery. A man known only as Mr. Brown is seeking a top-secret document that could destroy Great Britain, a document last held by a young girl who survived the sinking of the Lusitania. It is up to Tommy and Tuppence to recover the document and discover the identity of Mr. Brown. The Secret Adversary will keep you guessing to the end, and after you think you've solved the mystery, Agatha Christie plays her trump card and you will find your theories incorrect. If you like books by P.G. Wodehouse or the Lord Peter Whimsey series, you will enjoy Tommy and Tuppence's dialogue. If you love spy stories, you will enjoy the plot of this book. I highly recommend The Secret Adversary to anyone who loves Agatha Christie and to anyone who loves adventure."

Sure there are some things that are dated but I like to think of that as adding to the authenticity. And yes, by the time everything is sorted out at the end, it's pretty easy for the reader to say that the clues were all out there in plain sight. But as you read, Dame Agatha does a nice job of keeping you guessing. (This is due in part to her spliting up Tommy and Tuppence for the better part of the novel. The reader learns what each of them learn but they don't always have the chance to communicate with each other.)I enjoyed the political espionage aspects of the book as well as being able to see the evolving romance. The Russian Revolution is a very real thing for these characters as is the post-war readjustment.I haven't read any other books in the Beresford series but I really like the mix of spunk and pragmatism in these two. They have a youth and spirit and are a nice contrast to Marple and Poirot. I'll keep reading all three series but the Beresfords may get a bit of priority."

The characters, Tommy and Tuppence, are witty and charming, and will captivate instantly. These two young people meet after the war (WWI) in somewhat desperate straits- neither has a job, and each is facing the none-too-desirable notion that they will soon have to live with their families again. But they would rather have adventures.The romantic tension is light, but visible, as these two hatch out a plan to become Adventurers, and they meet adventure sooner than they realize. A name slipped out quite unconciously hurls them into the middle of international espionage, kidnapping, gang violence and more. Before they can blink, they are befriended by a rich American and a top British Government Intelligence agent, but who can they trust?The plot twists and turns adroitly, as only Agatha can write, leaving the reader wondering about the loyalties of every character, before laying out the final solution in a pulse-quickening final scene.Agatha Christie is known for her mysteries that leave readers guessing until the last chapter, and also for her depiction of English life from the 20's to the 70's, and this book has both of these. But this book is also a page-turning spy thriller, which you won't be able to put down until the very end.&lt;P"

0865651477,Jerusalem Architecture,,A38Y6IQF11EYEK,Michael Eliyahou,6/7,5.0,1085443200,From imagination to reality,"David Kroyanker has written a scholarly survey of architecture for the 3000-some years of Jerusalem's history. Perhaps more importantly for most of its audience, it is also a beautiful album of 700 photographs and illustrations, perfect for perusal on an end table or display stand. Even for those residents and tourists who have ready access to the city's neighbourhoods and ancient monuments, its bird's-eye views and snapshots from inside some of its exclusive places of worship are refreshing and educational.This is not primarily a history book, although one will learn much of the history of various kingdoms who have conquered the city and contributed to its architecture. There is emphasis on the fascinating recycling of stones and decorations through the centuries.Jerusalem has a certain mythology to it, and this work will help to add reality to the imaginary status many have given to the Holy City. It is also not a book that champions any particular religious cause. It simply the facts. Toward this end, consider the introduction on the inside jacket: ""Jerusalem, ancient city sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike, is an architectural wonder with a history of building that extends over three thousand years. It is also a living, vital city -- the New Jerusalem, capital of a modern state...."" These are the facts. One also cannot avoid the fact that the State of Israel is responsible for renovating and revitalisating its Old City districts, which were following into ruin until the 20th century. One should, in comparison, take a brief look at the editorial reviews on this page, and one will notice some peculiar editing being practiced. Notice anything missing?Finally, I would like to mention that it will be clear to the reader of this work that Jerusalem is NOT a ""mecca"", as entry is forbidden to noone based on race or religious affiliation. All are welcome in this city that is the centre of the world."

I like it better than Mounce'sGreek for the Rest of Us: Using Greek Tools without Mastering Biblical Greek. I took a year of Greek in college, and then began doing word studies the hard way with aStrong's Concordance. By trial and error, and a hunger to dig deeper, I learned how to use the lexicon at the back of the concordance to help clarify words and phrases while studying the Bible. What do you do when the 2 different greek words are translated into the same English word? What do you do when the same Greek word is translated into 2 different English words? How do you know if a verb carries certain shades of meaning that have an impact on the meaning of the verse? This book will walk you step by step through the process of using basic Greek tools to understand the Bible better, without necessarily knowing any Greek.Clark explains the differences between Strong's and Young's concordances, and how each is useful for differing tasks (it's far more than just looking up a verse). He walks you through how to do an English word study, and then how to do a Greek word study. He closes the book with aids to understanding some basic Greek grammar and how it affects interpretation. Included in the back is a very extensive list of books for going further in your study of Greek - Lexicons, concordances, grammars, study Bibles, word study helps, and even Hebrew resources. Probably the most comprehensive list I've come across.Learning to study the Bible and dig out the depths of it's truths is vital to Christian living. This book will help you begin to ""rightly divide the word of truth."" In all, I highly, HIGHLY, recommend it."
0782141927,Mac OS X Power Tools,,A386RCUI8V50R4,Emma Story,12/12,4.0,1059955200,A solid OS X book,"Here's the thing about book reviews: They're a lot easier to write when you either absolutely hated or absolutely adored the book in question. Once you've decided how you feel about it, it's easy to find a dozen examples of its mediocrity or excellence, as the case may be. However, I've been sitting on this particular review for a few weeks now, unable to finish it because I can't say that I feel very strongly at all about Power Tools. I recently decided, however, that being unable to form a definite opinion of it one way or another is itself a kind of opinion. There's nothing glaringly wrong with it or missing from it, but when it comes down to whether I'd choose to buy it over a different Mac book, I can't say that I would. I realize that this isn't a work of fiction - its goal isn't exactly to suck me in with thrilling plot twists so that I read the whole thing cover to cover in one sitting. Nevertheless, there are some other books out there that do exactly that (I'll get to them later), and I think I've been spoiled by reading them.What I LikedPower Tools covers its bases in a thorough, informative way. It's a solid OS X book, intended for anyone who understands the very basics involved in using a Mac. The author makes very clear early on that he's not intending to show you how to log in, or how to launch an application, but that's about the extent of the proficiency required, I think. Frakes seems to understand his audience and to address it consistently, which is rare enough to be refreshing. One of my pet peeves in technical writing concerns authors who can't decide who they're talking to - sidebars for beginners and power users are great, but when the body of the text itself waffles back and forth between skill levels, it can be both frustrating and confusing. This is a trap that Power Tools sidesteps completely: At the beginning of each section, you'll find a couple of lines telling you whether an Admin account is required for the techniques described, and whether the changes being made are system-wide or will affect only your own account. Mac OS X Hacks (which is, incidentally and confusingly enough, the Mac equivalent of O'Reilly's classic Unix Power Tools) uses a similar system to introduce each of the hacks in the book, and it's a practice that I'd like to see used more widely.What I Didn't LikeAlthough this is purely a matter of taste and I'm aware that there are many people who disagree with me, I just don't like Frakes's writing style. I have enjoyed some of his columns in the past, but it seems like his humor falls more than a little flat when stretched out over the course of a book. The alliterative titles were amusing for the first one or two chapters, but ""Apple-ication Aptitude"" is pushing it just a bit, I think. Although I realize that the first priority of a technical book is not to entertain its readers, exactly, is it too much to ask that it enthuse us? I was already interested in OS X before reading Power Tools, but I didn't find anything to excite me - how would a new Mac user fare?The Bottom LineThis is a perfectly adequate OS X book, and you wouldn't be wasting your money by buying it. Indeed, if you're already a fan of the author, you should probably do exactly that. For me, though, while it does a decent job of accomplishing the tasks it sets for itself, the book just never quite cuts it for me. The bottom line is really that if I had enough money to buy only a single Mac book, this wouldn't be it. I'd spend my forty dollars (or so) instead on either Mac OS X Unleashed or Mac OS X: The Missing Manual. Frakes actually recommends the latter as an alternative for absolute beginners who would be lost in his own book, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's just for novices. It really is a complete OS X manual, covering topics for users at every skill level. As for Unleashed, I've reviewed this book already (more recently than I have the Missing Manual) so I'll just say that if you want a Mac book so complete that it will introduce you to web programming so you can use of that default Apache installation, then that's a book you should consider. While I would prefer either one of these books to Power Tools if I were only able to buy one, it's also true that I'm not sorry to have added it to my collection (since, like most people, I'm not limited to one book per subject).And FurthermoreDan Frakes is a generally beloved Mac writer and developer and, my ambivalence about this book aside, his stuff is worth looking into. He contributes to the ""Mac OS X Secrets"" column in Macworld and is also involved in the 9th edition of the Mac Bible. His personal site is danfrakes.com, and the site for this book is at macosxpowertools.com."

It provides tons of great tips and tricks, but it really does make you understand the big picture, too--the reasons why you can or should do something. The book's contents are presented in a well thought-out order, and it is written very clearly--no guessing about what the author means. No confusing or ambiguous steps, which is especially important for the more advanced topics. My Mac is working better than ever after reading this book and I feel like I have the kind of advanced understanding of OS X that I didn't get from other books."

Mirror and lens, it reflects and refracts as much as we care to give into it; as much as we care to take the challenge of Rimbaud seriously for our place and our time."

1880684926,Crossing the River: Short Fiction by Nguyen Huy Thiep (Voices from Vietnam),16.95,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""",3/3,3.0,1190419200,"An excellent writer, undermined by some poor translation and poor editing","Nguyen Huy Thiep is a well known writer in Vietnam, remarkable for the way that his stories present the cruelties of man to each other (and themselves) and yet were widely circulated and popular. This collection from Curbstone Press collects together a wide range of stories that are translated by such writers as Linh Dinh and Dana Sachs. I first came across Nguyen Huy Thiep in the intriguing collection of Vietnamese fiction, Night, Again. The story in there, ""Without a King,"" is the story of a woman marrying into a family that is both cruel and loving, with a myriad of inner struggles and rivalries, including a brother who has an eye for the woman brought into their home.Many of Nguyen's stories are equally complex and wonderfully dark, examining the depth of their characters and allowing them to have their spiritual realizations and their moments of outrageous inconsideration and violence. Nguyen's writing is almost journalistic at times, with narrators who report the events of the stories, giving them an almost chilling verisimilitude. Another powerful story here is ""The General Retires,"" the story of an old soldier who comes home only to face further wars there, only of a psychological kind. One of my favorite stories in here was ""Rain,"" a rather short piece that examines love and separation.While I found myself quite impressed by Nguyen's talent, I also found myself rather put off by the sloppiness of the collection and some of the translations. Aside from finding occasional gross grammatical errors ('lightening' instead of 'lightning,' for example), but the separations between stories were sometimes quite bare, with a mere translator's note crammed into the bottom margin. Translations by Linh Dinh and Brigit Hussfeld conveyed a highly competent writer with a tight hold on his craft and form, while others felt loose in a way that I would chalk up more to poor translators than Nguyen. The commentaries, including the sophomoric comparison of Nguyen to Dostoevsky and Faulkner on the back cover, are all rather bland. I gained for more respect for Nguyen as a writer from the competently translated stories themselves rather than the editorial package, which offered little of interest on this writer I would like to know more about."

One word I would personally use to describe his work is lyrical, and yet another word would be stark. In fact he evokes a contradictory experience, which defies characterization. The stories seem simple, often depressing, and yet they have a grace and underlying imagery that is captivating.A recurring theme explores the inadequacy of heroes and traditional beliefs. However, much of the imagery, surroundings, and events are steeped in Buddhist and Vietnamese moral philosophy and Vietnamese myth and history. In many ways, this juxtaposition of aware struggle and darkly humorous acceptance seems to be a quintessential feature of Vietnamese culture. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in literature or who wishes a glimpse inside modern Vietnamese imagery."

Combine post-war devastation with less-than-component running of the economy and the loss of a major source of aid, the Soviet Union, and the Vietnamese government started a process of renovation or ""doi moi."" The intention was to bring the economy more in line with market forces, but the government also eased its controls on Vietnamese literature. The author's stories created a huge sensation and open controversy with their depiction of a society full of individualism and greed. This was in great contrast to the proletarian, government-approved stories that had been published up until that time. Some of these tales take place in the present day, while others include famous figures from Vietnamese history. Even the historical stories are characterized by alienation and lack of patriotism.This book is really good. These stories are about humanity, about people just trying to get through this thing called life. They are universal stories that could have been set anywhere in the world. It is very much worth reading, once the reader gets past the lack of familiarity with Vietnamese culture."

The first is for God to turn her into a boy, because she has something of a crush on Raquel, her teenaged neighbor; the second is for Eddie, her father, to disappear.A couple of times a week, Eddie beats Marci, and Corin, her younger sister, for some infraction, usually with his leather belt. It always occurs when Delia, their mother, isn't home. Eddie always accuses the girls of lying, or says that he had to break up their fight, and Delia always believes him. During an argument, Eddie leaves the house, and doesn't return. Delia is forced to get a job at the local Woolworth's, and things settle down at home. Several months later, during which time he has been living with a woman named Wanda, Delia takes Eddie back, despite the girls' pleading with her not to do so. The beatings resume.Marci and Corin disown Eddie as their father, refusing to call him ""Daddy"" or ""Father."" With help from a neighbor, they tie him up and threaten him with a switchblade. Marci gets a book on karate from the local library, intending to learn some moves to use on Eddie. He resumes his relationship with Wanda; Delia will accept a lot of things, but she will not tolerate Eddie even looking at another woman. Marci borrows a camera from her Uncle Tommy, and sits across the street from a local bar, intending to get pictures of Eddie and Wanda together. Unintentionally, the pictures get into Delia's hands, and then comes the ""final"" confrontation with Eddie.This book is not just about domestic violence. Marci nearly gets thrown out of catechism class, for asking too many questions that eleven-year-olds shouldn't ask. Her teacher, Miss Beauchamp, insists on speaking with a French accent, even though she is from Wisconsin. One day, at church, she sees Uncle Tommy and Father Chacon, the parish priest, come out of the same door in the confessional.In a way, this book is not pleasant reading, but it is very good reading. The author does a fine job at ""doing"" a pre-teen Latina. This book could easily take place in any part of America. All in all, it's very much worth reading."

Although the narrator, Marci, is only 11 years old, she makes profound observations about what holds her parents' marriage together in spite of her father's brutality and hence what prevents her mother from intervening to protect the children. Trujillo balances the horror of the father's cruelty with a lot of humor and great tenderness between the two sisters. She also reveals the roles of extended family members in the continuation of her family's troubles; some relatives attempt to shield the children, while others are unwittingly complicit in their suffering. It's a heartbreaking story overall, but Trujillo has such talent as a writer because it isn't a depressing read, and it doesn't leave you frustrated. On the contrary, the ending of the book finds the brutalized sisters empowered and on the road to recovery. If more people could read this book, perhaps this unfortunate pattern of so many women's co-dependent ""love"" leaving their children open to paternal abuse and permanent scars would be broken. Only by writers having the courage to explore family dynamics with the kind of honesty Trujillo does and readers openly discussing this widespread problem will things start to change within families. This is a good start & a great read."

Additionally, he frequently lapses to vague ramblings of general topics, like hawks hunting--always circling without so much as flapping a wing, but never swooping in to strike. The electronic format leaves much to be desired, what with the frequent grammatical and spelling errors (e.g. ""five"" or ""fives"" should be understood as ""live"" and ""lives"" respectively).However, he demonstrates profound wisdom and provides a few choice gems regarding some major tenets of the Christian faith."

Insisting that all persons are connected through a spiritual reality (later colored in Christian theology of the Holy Spirit), a concern of the ""other"" should be a dominant concern for the Christian. Though some are concerned they might not be praying enough, studying Bible, etc, Merton affirms that the second part of this equation is devotion to humanity and its welfare.Unlike prior Christian theologians that place dominant concerns to man's latent ability to overcome original sin, overt obsessions with sexual sin, and need for a return to those ""horse and buggy"" realities, Merton offers a differing view of Christian principles that empower the individual towards co-creating with G-d while affirming humanities potential for good."
B000J0U9QG,No Man Is An Island,,A1UQ6Q61M0CJJ0,Dennis Embo,16/32,5.0,1010534400,The heart of Catholic spirituality,"I found this classic a rather refreshing departure from some of the more modern &quot;spirituality&quot; titles from Catholic authors now coming out of some Catholic (and other) publishing houses. This book was published in 1955. Back then Catholic authors on topics of Christian sprirituality did not feel compelled to blindly follow the dictates of the &quot;NewSpeak&quot; a.k.a. &quot;inclusive language&quot; references to God (Merton appropriately refers to God as &quot;He&quot;). I have no problem with inclusive language in principal, but some modern writers go to absurd lengths _not_ to refer to God using any male pronouns (or worse, referring to God as He/She). Had Merton rewritten the book before he died I'm sure he would have made some modifications when making references to &quot;men&quot; and &quot;mankind,&quot; probably using the more generic &quot;mortals,&quot; &quot;human beings&quot; or &quot;humanity.&quot;Another welcome relief (from the more extreme synchretistic tendancies of writers purporting to write AS Catholics TO Catholics) is the pure &quot;Catholicity&quot; of the spirituality traditions Merton appeals to in _No Man Is An Island_. Anyone who has a familiarity with the history of Catholic sprirituality (esp. the contemplative variety) knows it goes back many centuries and is very rich. (Might I also include the doctrines of redemtive suffering and &quot;detachment&quot;?). That being the case it puzzles me why some modern Catholic writers feel it necessary to appeal to Buddhist, Zen, or other traditions of spirituality in order to illustrate &quot;Catholic&quot; themes of spirituality or holiness. Comparing traditions of spirituality is one thing, and as Catholics we should always, if possible, seek out the truths of whatever faith traditions we encounter, whether occidental or oriental. Some modern Catholic writers of this genre have unnecessarily thrown caution to the wind and for all intents and purposes jettisoned a heritage so rich and true in order to replace it with something that often does not quite hit the mark. In _No Man_ Merton scores a bullseye. (IMO it should be required reading in any parish adult formation program, it's THAT good.)"

Merton's flowing prose carries the reader so effortlessly, that I often had to stop myself, saturated, and put off going on until I had the capacity to absorb more. The greatest challenge of this book is not in comprehending his points, but in accepting them as actually possible, and internalizing their meaning for one's own life context. Merton opens a door to a place of potential joy, that many will desire to pass through."
B000J0U9QG,No Man Is An Island,,A1P0ZB4YAA312R,Wesley L. Janssen,90/91,5.0,1074816000,No Man is an Island.,"The writings gathered in this volume will not be read quickly or superficially. Paragraphs will continually ask to be reread. Thomas Merton's perspicacious meditations, offered with such poetic strength, are to his reader like veins whose rich ore leads the miner deep. The effort is real and so too is the reward. Merton (1915-1968) was a contemplative monk, a Trappist, and although most of his readers may think themselves of another world, so to speak, it is the world of which Merton writes which is Real, and the clabbering, self-directed world of our common experience that is illusory.A few thoughts, ones that are obviously directed more narrowly toward other Catholic monks, may generally be less helpful to most readers (I think of basically one chapter). I could offer other minor detraction but it would probably only amount to vanity on my part. It will be more valuable to meditate on these words of Merton:&quot;Those who love their own noise are impatient of everything else. They constantly defile the silence of the forests and the mountains and the sea. They bore through silent nature in every direction with their machines, for fear that the calm world might accuse them of their own emptiness. The urgency of their swift movement seems to ignore the tranquillity of nature by pretending to have a purpose. The loud plane seems for a moment to deny the reality of the clouds and of the sky, by its direction, its noise, and its pretended strength. The silence of the sky remains when the plane has gone. The tranquility of the clouds will remain when the plane has fallen apart. It is the silence of the world that is real. Our noise, our business, our purposes, and all our fatuous statements about our purposes, our business, and our noise: these are the illusion. God is present, and His thought is alive and awake in the fullness and depth and breadth of all the silences of the world. The Lord is watching in the almond trees [Jer 1.11, 12]. . . Whether the plane pass by tonight or tomorrow . . . whether the liner enters the harbor full of tourists or full of soldiers, the almond tree brings forth her fruit in silence.&quot;There are some men for whom a tree has no reality until they think of cutting it down . . . men who never look at anything until they decide to abuse it and who never even notice what they do not want to destroy. These men can hardly know the silence of love: for their love is the absorption of another person's silence into their own noise. And because they do not know the silence of love, they cannot know the silence of God . . . Who is bound, by His own law of Charity, to give life to all those whom He draws into His own silence.&quot;"

Merton exemplifies a life lived in the spirit of God. There are many enemies of the spirit but the first enemy is our own self ( our ego). We love to be in control, to share our opinions, we are so afraid to let go, to go within and listen to the silence. Only when we listen with an open heart can we start living our real self with no mask. Our busyness turns to a more peaceful existence, we become more creative and less stressed, more grateful and less in need of stimulus . Less powerful but more compassionate. We are less fearful and more trusting of ourselves and others. Less depressed and more self accepting. The inner soul created in the image of God. This is our true being. ""To be or not to be that is the question."""
B000J0U9QG,No Man Is An Island,,A3EJT905S6ZS4K,R. Schwartz,29/30,5.0,1008547200,Profound,"&quot;No Man Is An Island&quot; can only be described as profound. There are many superb writings of spiritualiy, God and Christ. Thomas Merton's book is one that should not be passed up, it is absolutely profound for the interior solitude, the silence within, our silence where we find God's silence, who knows us and where we know Him. A book by a man of God for men of God, Merton goes far beyond religious organizational teachings and human thinking, to that of the spiritual life with God. I can only say, I have new found respect for the Catholic church, for Merton does not write in defense of her, but for God, men and charity, that go far beyond this life, existing now within us, and bring us to the real life we seek."
B000J0U9QG,No Man Is An Island,,,,27/28,5.0,916185600,Merton distills the essence of a Christian life powerfully.,"Merton's understanding of our human nature and his spiritual understanding of scripture combine to make a personally challenging and thoroughly understandable realization of how to become more spiritual, not religious.

Having read only a little of Merton, I found this book somewhat more straightforward and prosaic compared to a later work of his, ""The New Man"", and he gets a tad dogmatic in spots (well, he is ordained, so he has a license to do so, fair enough)--I was reminded of some of the more trenchant passages in ""The Seven Storey Mountain"" before he'd mellowed out a bit. And yet Merton's characteristic mix of simplicity and profundity, his fine-tuned mystic's sense of paradox, and his ability to take Catholic teachings and breathe new life into them are all here in full; indeed, in many ways this book would serve very well as a Catholic Monastic statement of what life's all about, spoken in Merton's gentle conversational tones at once calm and serious, critical of the shallow aspects of modernity while articulated in a manner that speaks eloquently to modern people. I have no doubt that this book should appeal to readers who profess Christianity as their religion, but I also think that many non-Christians (such as myself) will find much here that is inspiring and spiritually enlightening."

Because the book was composed during Merton's life time by him, it is untainted by editors and others with ill vested interests.Covering a wide range of spiritual topics, it is difficult to pick a specific theme for this book. Obviously, the thoughts involve the Christian faith. Being a monk, many of his discussions involve solitude and its accompanying components. Each reader will likely take pleasure in a differing passage that touches their own soul. I would suggest a pencil to accompany reading this book in order to highlight favorite passages.Being one of the premiere Catholic and spiritual writers of the 20th Century, Merton's writing has received just commendation.

Rather than attempting different voices for the characters, he simply raised and lowered his voice. I found some of his ""characterizations"" so affected sounding, that I had to put the book away. As he also narrates the next book in the Quinn saga, I guess I won't be listening to this series in the future. I would give the book 5 stars, but took away 2 for the lousy audio version"

Ever since the first book I read of hers (Hidden Riches), I have rarely if ever been disappointed by a Nora Roberts book.I laughed out loud at the conversations between the brothers, as did my mother (she rarely laughs out loud when reading a book), particularly the shopping episode!My only complaint about Nora's books continues to be the lack of proofing throughout her novels. Particularly in the last 3 years, there always seem to be an enormous amount of typos and other inconsistencies that should have been caught by someone in the publishing process. (Hence the &quot;9&quot; rating rather than &quot;10.&quot;)Overall, you still can't find a better read than one of Nora's stories. I've even taken to her JD Robb books, and I'm not a fan of futuristic novels! Wow!

I loved how she went into such detail with the relationship between Seth and Cameron. I felt like I knew them after I finished the book. I think that some writers have a hard time getting up close and personal with the characters in their books, but this is not the case with Nora Roberts. I thought that Cam's relationship with Anna was intriguing and somewhat steamy, though it wasn't the best that she had ever conjured, but very enjoyable nonetheless. I would definitely recommend adding this to your personal library. I figure sometime soon, I'll have to read it again, like right before I read Ethan's story!"

While Cameron and Anna find each other and a consuming love, the author weaves a magical web of mystery and anticipation surrounding the roots of the young boy, Seth, and the unexpected death of the father, Ray Quinn, and leaves the reader anxiously waiting for resolution in the upcoming books. The next book in the series will be Ethan Quinn's story, no doubt another great story about a strong man with good old family values and integrity.

The characters were portrayed with the warmth and humor we are accustomed to from Ms. Roberts. Having to wait so long for the next book in the series will be rough, but well worth it, I'm sure. Ms. Roberts' portrayal of the troubled young Seth is bittersweet. The relationship between Cameron and Seth is a mixture of sweet, sad and funny. This story line alone would have been enough to keep me reading, but then we have the treat of watching Cameron fall for a social worker who keeps him on his toes. We fall for Anna as well. She seems a very real character, tough yet gentle. Her difficult life's experiences have shaped her for the better and her compassion for Seth is heartwarming. On the one to ten scale, I'd rate this book an eleven!"

Someone in personnel feels she would make a great Mrs. Claus. Santa asks all the Christmas help to place their wishes in the stockings. Olivia's wish: a do-over. And, boy does she get it.In the second story, Cassie, a single mother, window decorator for San Francisco's Rossman's (which is on the verge of failing), has her own wish. A Chicago head honcho for the department store comes to the store and tells the employees to help save costs, each employee has to pull double duty. Cassie is hesitant but the personnel manager says she has the perfect job for her. Cassie tries the Mrs. Claus suit on and it fits perfectly. In the pocket of the jacket is a note left by Mrs. C. The note reads ""This suit brings luck. Go with it. Mrs. C."" Cassie's wish is simple, a father who is involved with her son's life. Will the suit bring luck? Does Cassie get her wish? Magic will lead her down the path of trying to get her son's father involved in his life.In the third story, Meredith, the Rossman's heiress, is challenged by her uncle for a spot on the board. Simple. Just increase toy sales 50% from the previous year and the spot on the board is hers. Not so simple for Meredith, who is not very big on Christmas-time business because she lost her parents on Christmas day two years prior--and so has lost her Christmas spirit and belief in magic. She inherits the job of wearing the Mrs. Claus suit and be a part of Santaland during the Christmas season, where she works on upping sales.

Do not dive into this book thinking that it is a graphic novel. Nothing could be further from the truth. Creepshow is done entirely in the tongue-in-cheek style of the old horror comics. The host is a wise-cracking undead version of Stan Lee himself and the stories, while still a bit scary for the most part, are fairly lame.This is not to say that Creepshow is not a fun, quick read. I read it in an evening and like most of the comic books that I have floating around from my childhood, I guarantee that I'll pick it up and read it again at some point in the future. That's the beauty of comics, there's no need for deep thinking. It's something that you can pick up, lose yourself in for an hour or two and be finished with it.

First of all, it was published by a paperback publisher instead of a comic book publisher--in other words, people who didn't know how far comics had advanced by then in regards to content: thus, language was heavily censored.Second, famed magazine horror illustrator Bernie Wrightson was used for the artwork. His artwork, while detailed, was more in line for magazine proportions instead of comic book proportions, thus necessitating a larger page count to handle all the extra pages, thus meaning that he had to use a first draft of the screenplay. All in all, it means that the action in the comic book adaptation doesn't match the movie at all. (Meanwhile, Jack Kamen was hired to do the storyboards and the comic book prop used in the movie. Why they didn't release that instead no one can say.)Finally, the comic book uses an intrusive narrator to tell the stories, whereas anthology horror comics routinely use narrators merely as framing devices (though a handful used them as characters in their stories too). It can be annoying for the reader to see the narrator continually prompting the reader for a reaction.If you want to see how this movie was originally proposed to be made, get this book. If you want to see what a prose publisher thought horror comics were at the time (and good horror comics were around then: Twisted Tales, Tales of Terror for two titles), get this book. If you want to see a book that misuses a framing device, get this book.However, if you like good horror comics, if you remember the horror comics of the 50's fondly, or if you like the movie...avoid this book at all costs!"

However, the movies based on his books never seem to generate the passionate fear that his books do. I attribute this to the fact that less imagination is required in the movies, which means that there is less suspension of reality. This book is a set of cartoons based on the movie of the same name by George A. Romero.The cartoons plus dialog is not scary, and while the artwork is good, it cannot be described as spectacular. My favorite story is ""The Crate"", where a monster was somehow captured in an expedition to the Arctic a half century earlier. The idea that it somehow lay dormant all that time was absurd, but the interesting part to me was the shrewish wife of a college professor. As an academic, the (exaggerated) subplot of academic politics running throughout the story kept my interest.If you are a Stephen King fan, you will probably find the cartoons of interest. However, King is one of those people whose ideas are best savored in written form, where the scary details can be up close and personal. That takes away some of the force of the stories."

I also liked the way Wrightson made some of the characters look like those who played them in the movie version, like Leslie Nielsen and Hal Holbrook.I really like King's way of prose. It's just like those old comics, especially the way The Creep jokes around while he introduces and concludes the five tales. My personal favorits from the movie was Father's Day, which both scared me and made me giggle at times. In the comicbook it's more funny than scary. The Crate was the second best, anyway the goriest and scariest and most powerful story in the movie, but also in the comicversion it works just as well.Also I have to say that King made a hell of a performance as Jordy Verrill in the movie.Creepshow is great fun and great chill, mostly for those who remembered and loved the old E.C.magazines."

He created that ambiguity of biota and machine. This book, with less concern for censorship, drives those images far beyond what the theaters can accept.I read this book with a choked fascination. Giger uses all of his technical mastery in depicting landscapes of torment, eroticism, deformity, and beauty. This world is peopled by multiple beings, fused by birth, by force, or by carnality. His work reminds me of Druillet, where every scene is packed from edge to edge with bizarre detail. Giger goes beyond Druillet with his realistic style, making his monochrome worlds so much more convincing.Although the Amazon web site lists Timothy Leary as a co-author, he just provides a one-page introduction. It's good, and it's Leary, but Leary fans shouldn't get their hopes up too far.If you like Giger's work, as I do, this is an incredible collection. (If the imagery is too much for you, I understand.)This book also provides autobiographical notes, but I take those about as seriously as I take Salvador Dali's.

It happens so that Allan Quatermain stops by his Zulu friend's kraal (to those of you who never read Haggard, Kraal=household) to find that yet another friend is madly in love with the well known beauty: Mameena, or, in other words, Child of the Storm. Allan is curious to see this well known Mameena, but his friend who is in love with Mameena (his name is Saduko) goes on a crazy battle to win 100 cattle for Mameena's dowry. After going with Saduko on his quest and helping him win 600 cattle, Allan meets Mameena, and determines she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and, though at that time Africans were thought of as savages (most unjustly, I have to add), Allan, after observing some treachery done by Mameena while pretending to be unconscious, after knowing she was false, cannot find any reason to resist her love to him, for indeed Mameena tries to engage him in a marriage, but Allan remembers her treachery and tells her no. Many adventures follow after that, until the Zulu King declares Mameena a witch, and Mameena pleads guilty. It is not the kind of Salem witchcraft that is talked about here. It is more like herb-knowledge and doctoring that the Zulus call witchcraft. After recieving her death sentence for many more offenses, including causing a civil war and it's outcome, Mameena makes a last wish. The last wish is... You'll have to figure out this as you read along with the mystery of Mameena's character. Suggested background books: Any Allan Quatermain book. Here are some Allan Quatermain titles: Allan and the Holy Flower, Marie, Allan's Wife, King Solomon's Mines, She and Allan, The Ancient Allan, Et cetera."

He talks about the balance between &quot;containment&quot; and &quot;contact&quot; in the social dimension.

I've read that puppies shouldn't be given honey so I tend to just omit this ingredient and replace it with water or whatever veggie is in the recipe.**Helpful Hints** If you want to use cookie cutters to make these, I suggest rolling them pretty thinly. Then it's easier to break in half to treat your dog while keeping a close eye on their caloric intake. I never feel guilty about giving them any of these...although the Peanut Butter one I do give sparingly.Overall, good recipes, good cooking method (double bake to get that crunch), good flavor. My dogs won't take many commercial treats but they go crazy for these homemade cookies.This should be among the cookbok staples of a cook devoted to homemade canine cuisine."

Since this option wasn't available, I went with 5 stars.It's VERY hard to find a good book that covers nutrition for dogs and provides decent recipes. With the dog food industry being in control of pet nutrition through the AAFCO (pretty much created by and for the dog food industries), it can be difficult to find ""unbiased"" solid information on healthy pet nutrition; with the use of whole-foods.With that note in mind, this book is very good to use as a general guideline for preparing whole-foods for your dog. I'd recommend this book to everyone who is interested in making and preparing foods for their dogs. I would not recommend it as the only book though.""Better Foods for Dogs"" provides a good amount of information on nutritional needs for dogs and helps give recipes that are rather easy to prepare. The recipe sections are categorized by weight of dog; ranging from smallest at 5 lbs to the largest at 150 lbs. This is very convenient for the pet parent. Each ""complete meal"" recipe does require adding bonemeal and multi-vitamin & mineral supplements. There are also recipes included for ""cookies"" (snacks and treats).Allergy note: Some of the complete meal recipes do involve using wheat and/or dairy products. If your dog has a food allergy to either of these products, you can find substitution recommendations in this book. In the ""cookies"" section, some of the recipies do include the use of wheat, all purpose flour, cornmeal and/or dairy products. These can be altered using different ingredients; given that you have a general knowledge with using substitutions in baking.Overall, the book is outstanding and provides enough information for the average person to get started on home cooking and preparing healthy foods for their dogs. It also provides very useful information on monitoring your dog's health while feeding home prepared diets. The complete meal recipes follow the ratio of 40% protein/45% carbohydrates/15% fats (the average requirement for adult dogs).For feeding dogs with special needs regarding health conditions, this book will still provide useful information, BUT you will need to alter recipes by adding or subtracting to the ratio of proteins, carbohydrates and fats; based on what is recommended by your dog's veterinarian (and/or veterinarian specialist). In the same token of thought, if your dog is less active or has a higher activity level, you may also need to alter these recipes."

There are two basic Fruit/Vegetable mixes provided in the book, and while one of them does include whole corn, you can easily substitute another vegetable (peas, broccoli, zucchini) for the corn. I've found all of the recipes easy to make and this book is much easier to follow than the more complicated BARF diets. And while some people may want to steam the carrots, I've found that my dogs are quite content eating raw carrots. In fact, my Golden is very happy to chew carrots, apples and tomatoes, making this recipe very simple to prepare. I've also borrowed the idea of feeding eggshells to my dogs from the BARF diet.The best part is: all six of my dogs love the food. And it's satisfying knowing I'm feeding them quality ingredients."

Easy to use and adapt,"This is a great book! Don't believe the person who said it's difficult to use. Each recipe explains in a side note box how many portions the recipe makes. Technically, even though it covers recipes for dogs that range from 5 to 150 pounds, you can probably adapt just about any recipe though common sense. If a 15 pound dog eats 1/3 of a cup of ground beef - then the recipe that has 2 1/2 cups of a meat for a WAY larger size animal can be paired down to the same amount using simple math and some division.Also, this isn't just a book with recipes. It explains portions and gives you a substituting list for alternating meats within recipes. There's a section on how to convert the dog and a section on vitamins and nutrition. They talk about food elimination if you're dealing with allergies. Honestly, it's a very well rounded book with lots of interesting information. I find myself going back to it on occasion to compare what I'm trying at times so that I'm doing the right portions.Either way, you can easily adapt the recipes once you look through the book. The point is, it gives you some great ideas and makes you understand what kinds of meals can be cooked for you pup. Also, there are some great sections that explain the preparation of the veggies and fruits. My only recommendation is to not puree the veggies and fruits into a blend that's like soup. We chopped them and cooked them so they were al dente crispy and that took care of the mush problem someone mentioned.I think this book is very helpful for that person who wants to cook for their dog but has no idea about how to start. It'll get you on the right path and will probably become a reference material that you'll go back to (especially if you do the math and go all out and make all the good doggie recipes). They do have doggie snacks in the back for those who want some snacks instead of those horrible hard biscuits available in the stores.Monica"

B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,A3K0HQQ0CNY1CT,Hovig J. Heghinian,76/78,4.0,1043020800,"Thoughtful, intelligent, meaningful, and universal.","""The Drowned and the Saved"" is the final book of Primo Levi (1919-1987), a Jewish-Italian chemist who survived the death camp of Auschwitz, and turned to authorship in his later years. This book is a group of a half-dozen related essays, each exploring a specific aspect of Levi's view of the Holocaust's causes and effects.He begins with the concept of ""good faith"", wondering whether believing a lie excuses it. He notes that oppressors lie to save themselves from believing they are evil, and victims lie to save themselves from believing they suffer. He explores the moral zone between black and white, noting that anybody can be a tough killer or a foolish victim: we are all tyrants and victims in our own way.He examines survivor's guilt, and reflects on the roles of luck versus blessing in life, and discusses the ways humans need communication to survive, including the way victims bend language to disguise their intentions, and tyrants twist it to cause confusion among their victims.He tries to distinguish between rationalized evil and collective madness. He believes the spirit and mind can be injured just as the body can, and wonders how a person's perspective plays a role in their survival and psychological health. He describes the various stereotypes people hold when they imagine the stories of those who lived through WWII, e.g., the romantic hero, the evil Nazi, the prisoner who always plots escape, and so on, but explains why they are rough and inaccurate.Each chapter is like a conversation with an intelligent and qualified author. It is thoughtful, and a pleasure to read. It reflects on psychological and historical themes which are important not only to our understanding of the Holocaust, but also more generally human nature. (It appears to be a rumination on subjects discussed in his other books, collected and summarized briefly here.) It is for this reason that the book is successful. It considers the Holocaust in particular, but its themes are actually deeper and more universal.""Letters from Germans"", the penultimate chapter, is the book's most powerful, noticeably demonstrating the tension between his memory of that time period, and the memory of various Germans, in their own words. He especially berates those who believe they are doing the right thing by speaking out in shame and guilt over theit past, perhaps attacking them a bit harshly, but certainly with justification. The last chapter, ""Conclusion"", is its weakest. In the opinion of this reviewer, it over-generalizes, and tries to apply retrospective analysis to the world's future. It also calls for unwarranted conclusions, unrelated to the preceding chapters, and perhaps contradicts itself. Luckily it is brief, and does not detract from the excellence of the prior explorations.(For example, he says war is unecessary, and mankind can settle all conflicts around a table, but only as long as we are in good faith. He then calls Hitler a buffoon, implying he cannot be taken in good faith. He next says we need not have good faith to negotiate if we are all equally in fear of war, but this sounds like he is saying war is necessary after all, even if only to remind us there are punishments for negotiation in bad faith!)Despite its conclusion (which many readers will probably enjoy, despite this reviewer's belief it over-reaches), the book is an intelligent and even-handed, but personal assessment of the Holocaust, written in an engaging and intelligent style, with brevity and wit. At 200 pages, it is easy to read. Packed with philosophy and insight, it is worth the investment."
B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,,,43/44,5.0,1006905600,Primo Levi's Enduring Considerations of Auschwitz,"The Drowned and the Saved is the haunting last-word meditation of the late Primo Levi on his Auschwitz camp experience. Describing his 1987 work as a collection of ""considerations"" rather than distinct memories, the thoughtful Levi nevertheless attempts to maintain--as much as possible--the spirit of the Auschwitz truth inevitably eroded, enhanced, or otherwise altered by the passage of 40 years and the flaws of memory: He writes in the first chapter (""The Memory of the Offense"") that this later work is still considerably informed by and in concert with the substantial Holocaust literature of the ""submerged"" (i.e, the perished) and the ""saved"" that has accumulated since the publication of his 1947 memoir Survival in Auschwitz. But Levi writes, the submerged are the true, albeit lost, witnesses. Only imperfect witness of the monstrous Holocaust experience is available from the saved, like himself.In The Drowned and the Saved, Levi provides a discerning and articulate exposition of the psychological and sociological peculiarities of the Auschwitz camp--ideas virtually unexplored in popular literature and movies. Throughout the work, he discusses the collective responsibility of nonvictims (in his view, the entire German population) and of the moral dilemmas that arose in a horribly victimized, imprisoned community that was wildly pluralistic (in nationality, language, religion, education, trade, and individual personality). (Tensions between the disparate concepts of collective and individual responsibilities are mostly implicitly explored and not fully crystallized, however, by the author.) Levi explains the complex hierarchy and moral ""gray zone"" among Auschwitz prisoners who severely compromised humanitarian considerations for fellow inmates and supported the camp's illogical infrastructure to improve survival. Deep anguish befell the unfortunate intellectual who attempted to make sense of his utterly nonsensical existence.In ""Shame,"" ""Communicating,"" and ""Useless Violence,"" Levi expatiates the Nazi perpetration of its systematic dehumanization, from the moment of transport to complete demoralization entrenched shortly after arrival. The explanation is necessary for the contemporary reader to understand later the feelings of absurdity (or even offense) aroused in the Auschwitz survivor when faced with the external world's disbelief that escape and revolt were not often thought of, much less attempted. In Auschwitz, escape and revolt did occur, to be sure, but infrequently and more often among the better fed and less severely victimized prisoners who were multilingual (most were imprisoned in a foreign country). And failed attempts were invariably countered by the SS's extremely public and vicious brands of individual and general punishment.Levi concludes his reflective work by presenting selected letters from ignorant and/or apologetic Germans after publication of his 1947 memoir (which the reader is advised to read beforehand). Finally Levi warns of the repetition of a kind of Auschwitz, if the core memory of it and the German responsibility for it are not maintained. But even Levi's reflective considerations of this peculiar historical hell are difficult, if not impossible, for the contemporary reader without direct connection to the Holocaust to know fully or hold onto. Periodic re-reading of Levi's writing is therefore recommended."
B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,ADWMWBCN8DVUX,Signorelli Luca,70/76,5.0,981072000,The real thing,"How can I begin?Primo Levi died in spring 1987, in a still unclear accident (someone say a suicide) in his Turin house - few hundred yards from where I lived at the time, and not far away from where I'm writing now. I don't really know if he really killed himself (he didn't leave any note, and staircase rail was low, very low) but I know that his last book (&quot;The Drowned And The Saved&quot;) is a book that trasceend any human notion of absolute, unblinking truth.Primo Levi was a men obsessed by truth. He lived trough one of the most extreme experience a XX century's man could live - one year in Auschwitz. After coming back home, he resume is life as a chemistry expert (he was the director of a small company). He became a writer almost by chance. He was urged to tell the truth about the Holocaust - not the trascendental, nobilitating, almost religious experience movies like &quot;Schindler's List&quot; had make us believe, but something horrible, degrading, a donward spiral in a world where only the worst survive - and the best, the good people, the one deserving survival, die. It called it &quot;the grey zone&quot;. It wrote that he came back because he was lucky, because he compromised with the lager system (altrough what saved him was only being a chemistry graduate in a death camp that needed chemistry experts to produce synthetic rubber). He tried, in the mosth unflinching and direct way, to tell the world that being an Auschwitz survivor wasn't a badge of goodness. Actually, it was exactly the reverse.In &quot;If This Is A Man&quot; (his memories of Auschwitz), he wrote about his experience in a neutral, documentary style. Thirty years laters, he returned (for the first and last time) on the subject. And what he did was writing a small, focused, terryfing insight in something he tried to understand in his whole life: how was possible? How did someone get out of it? Will it happen again?Primo Levi was an optimist, but he was a realist too. He basically believed in his fellow humans. But he could get away with the inner feeling that the very existence of Auschwitz was - basically - a contradiction of everything that's worth in life, a cancer that had contamitated everything that had come afterward - the drowned AND the saved, the butchers AND the victims. Nothing is spared, nothing is kept in the background: betrayal, collaboration, compromise, degradation, evil, the gray reality of Auschwitz. &quot;The Drowned And The Saved&quot; is the wall against whom any &quot;negationist&quot; lie simply vaporise - you can't deny it, you can't downplay it. It's a technical book on the killing joke humanity did on itself, and Primo Levi, without laughing, admitted that the joke was on him.Simply - he didn't changew the rules of the game when he felt it was going to lose it."
B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,,,21/21,5.0,862099200,How should we remember the Holocaust?,"Levi was an Italian Jew who survived the Holocaust despite incarceration in Auschwitz. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED is his final book, and it is not so much about the events of the Holocaust themselves as it is about how we have come to remember and understand the Holocaust, the most horrific crime in human history, the author persuasively argues. Levi's book exposes the pitfalls of human memory, exploring the nature of history, asking how we might honestly represent to posterity crimes that are literally unspeakable. By taking a modest but crucial step back from the actual crimes, Levi holds up for his reader's examination both the need for and the limits on our already somewhat distanced historical perspective on the Holocaust. Levi was worried about the myths and metaphors that had already attached themselves to the Holocaust within his lifetime, stylized intellectual ivy already obscuring the ruined walls of recent history. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED attempts to clear away this overgowth, to preserve the ruin as starkly, as nakedly, as might still be possible"
B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,A3S0MOCC2TPG70,Ryan,20/20,5.0,989798400,You must understand,"I write this mostly for the previous reviewer, but also for those who might be made uneasy by it. Primo Levi is the most precise author I have ever read. He has made a glimpse of the Holocaust available to those of us who never had the misfortune of being submerged in it. He has made real what he himself said would be harder and harder to grasp for others as the years go by. I write this partly due to his call and the call of so many other survivors that we now must bear witness for them. It sounds a little sappy and overly melodramatic, but there will be a time when only the students of the Holocaust and the books and media created concerning it will remain. We must remind students and our youth of the banality of evil and the ease in which hatred can run wild. Anyone who desires proof of this need only look at the school violence that pervades our lives every year. Some of the answers of how &quot;useless violence&quot; comes about are found in these pages.Instead of reporting just the &quot;what&quot; Levi explains the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; the Holocaust carried out so efficiently. He explains the life in the Lager, the endless roll calls, and the pointless work that existed for the sole purpose of humiliation. He defines the &quot;gray zone&quot; in which survival from the Holocaust was achieved only by participation in it. He explains that survival had a price and that the honest and good were the first to perish. Levi tells us this from the perspective of a survivor trying to understand, a scientist reasoning a problem soundly, only passing judgement on those that he has an explicit right to. Primo Levi also makes known the profound changes that occurred before, during, and after the ordeal to him and others and his work is not without this reflection. He points out the similarities of more current events in our world today. Levi also tells us that an atrocity like this can happen again but does not have to.More than any author of fiction or nonfiction I have found Levi's books fascinating by the wisdom they contain. Each idea is succinct. Every story is relevant to a deep understanding. To say that you are not at all the wiser after reading this book is only to say that you did not read the book. You did not think about what it says about us as human beings and what we are capable of.I read this book in college and I just finished reading it again tonight. It is, I can honestly say, the best education I received. It is my hope that if you do read this book, you will think about what it says, because the words are true."

Words simply cannot do it justice; even four decades after the camps were &quot;liberated,&quot; Levi's experience during the war remains for him (and to us) an exposed nerve. While Levi is unremitting in his condemnation of the Nazis and those Germans who stood silently by as unthinkable atrocitites were committed in their backyards, this book is evidence of a mind that, up until the very end, was still probing, still trying to understand, still offering up meaningful and timely questions which every human being--regardless of age or nationality or religion--should seriously ponder. The most striking aspect of this short narrative is its utter sincerity--Levi does not reach for hyperbole (though it's hard to exaggerate the inhumanity of the concentration camps), nor does he meditate at length on abstruse philosophy; to the contrary, he is always painfully, even brutally, honest and straightforward. His death was a great tragedy, but his written legacy is an even greater triumph; The Drowned and the Saved should be required reading for all."

From the willful murderers, the guilty bystander to the guilt-ridden born-after-fact heirs, Primo attempts to examine their psyche and try to even measure their responsibility as a big why-and-how of what happened to him.This book is for more mature readers that understand the mechanics of helplessness, victimization and uncompensationable loss. He deliberately removes his emotion from his narration to better present it. In its dryness, it is the reader that has to supply the emotion from identifying. More than once I had to stop and weep because of the wave of shock and empathetic remorse that sweeps over me.It was easier for me to soak myself into his analysis because of the experiences I have had in life of loss, humiliation, helplessness and victimization. This book is not for everyone but its message should be at least heard by everyone. He offers a very strong and convincing thesis on the big WHY on the Holocaust which at the same time encompasses the other WHYs of human suffering.While it gives a very valuable introspective on moral reponsibility, there is a very strong underlying call to be sensitive to the signs of evil around us. Our silent acquiescences to the wrongs around us everyday does make us complicit in its growing destructiveness. The evils that we allow to crawl around us eventually creep into our souls until we become its main players.As the morality of the world around us gets very complicated with people suing in the US for some of the silliest things while people in some countries can still be pulled out of their beds in the middle of the night and shot in front of their families (who have to live with the pangs of injustice for the rest of their lives), we are forced to ask: are human societies cursed to such levels of denseness?Primo's book is a valuable piece of exmination that very few can ever really identify with because it is too deep and complex for the Facebook crowd of today. I see his founded fears now that the lessons will be lost."
B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,A2YXRT2XIJIO57,John P. Jones III,8/8,5.0,1271980800,The Gray Zone...,"This is Primo Levi's last reflections on the Holocaust. His most famous book, published shortly after his experience in it, is entitled in the English language version,Survival In AuschwitzThis collection of essays was written almost 40 years later, shortly before his death. It will never be definitely determined if he committed suicide in 1987, but the possibility that he may have adds poignancy to the various passages in these essays in which he discusses the suicide of other survivors of the Holocaust, including his friend, and fellow intellectual, Jean Am&eacute;ry. In the essay fittingly entitled ""Stereotypes,"" Levi was quite clear about why he felt these essays were necessary: ""... the gap that exists and grows wider every year between things as they were `down there' and things as they are represented by the current imagination fed by approximative books, films, and myths. It slides fatally toward simplification and stereotype, a trend against which I would like here to erect a dike.""To that end, one of the very strongest essays in this collection is entitled ""The Gray Zone."" Levi says ""It is a gray zone, poorly defined, where the two camps of masters and servants both diverge and converge. This gray zone possesses an incredibly complicated internal structure and contains within itself enough to confuse our need to judge."" The author goes on to describe a system - a `primitive' one, to use his word, where humans have regressed towards earlier societal models, where the first blows and kicks that a new arrival receives are all too often delivered by their fellow inmates, some with the status of ""Capos,"" as opposed to the individuals who are normally considered the ultimate in sadistic behavior, the SS. As Levi says: ""Vying for prestige also came into play, a seemingly irrepressible need in our civilization: the despised crowd of seniors was prone to recognize in the new arrival a target on which to vent its humiliation, to find compensation at his expense, to build for itself and at his expense a figure of a lower rank on whom to discharge the burden of the offenses received from above."" As Levi describes, much of the experience of a new arrival would parallel that of a new conscript to basic army training, including the haircut. In the same essay there is an excellent depiction of Chaim Rumkowski, who was the self-styled leader of the Lodz ghetto, before he too was deported to the concentration camps, or, to use the author's word, the ""Lager.""Should the Holocaust be capitalized, and none of the others, such as the Armenian or Cambodian? To Levi's credit, he does refer to the others; and in particular mentions the auto-genocide in Cambodia a few times. But Levi, perhaps naturally, leans towards the primacy of the evil of the one that almost killed him. I consider this a sterile debate, and often think of the young soldier in the movie ""Hearts and Minds"" who took some form of solace in stating that he lost both his legs in one of the ""largest ambushes of the war."" And I compare that to Remarque's treatment of his protagonist, who died on a day that was so quiet and still that the high command confined itself to a single sentence:Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)The evil has occurred to the individual; does the magnitude of the context make it more or less tragic? For Americans, the greater responsibility should lay with the holocaust that we helped provoke rather than the one we helped to stop.The essays are only 200 pages long, but are so rich in insights. Levi stresses that those that survived in the Lagers invariably were in some ""special circumstances,"" as he was, both being a chemist, and having contracted scarlet fever just as all the others were forced on a death march prior to the liberation of the camp by the Soviet Army. He has an entire essay on the gratuitous ""useless"" violence in the camps. The author has the eye for the telling, and often times ironic details: for example, the Jews were forbidden from playing music that was composed by Aryans, yet, since there were no other musicians available, in the camps they were permitted, even compelled, to play the requisite band marches. I found the final section particularly significant: the letters that Levi had received from his German readers, which presented a broad range of responses, from continued rationalizations to compelling sorrow from those with ""hands that were clean.""Should be required reading in all our schools. An excellent 5-star plus read."

This was Levi's final wrestling with the implications of what he called the Lager (he didn't use the term 'Holocaust'), not only as he experienced it, but more generally.Just a few points that may be less obvious. Levi never uses the phrase ""survivor guilt,"" and his choice of terms was never without consideration. Rather, he uses the term, ""shame."" The chapter that goes by that name is an enormously subtle and evolving one. Levi continues to probe the feeling as he recalls it after ""liberation,"" and there are at least five different concepts of what that ""shame"" entailed, no one of which did Levi think was definitive. By the way, none of Levi's definitions are the same as the popular notion of ""survivor"" guilt - that one feels guilty simply for having survived while others did not. The closest he comes is to talk about surviving ""in place of another,"" which is a more complex idea. It refers specifically to the nature of the camps themselves, a horrific ""laboratory,"" as Levi put it, in which selections, influence, luck and more did mean that one's survival always came at someone else's cost. This is a sociological point. It would not the case, for example, for the survivor of a tornado or earthquake.Second, the ""grey zone"" is very often misinterpreted to suggest that perpetrators and victims met in some ""middle ground"" somewhere. Levi is definitive about this. The responsibility of the killers and the victims are in no sense, and in no context, equivalent. But in the squalid and horrific world that was the lager, there was an enormous range of types and characters. Levi is arguing mostly against what he calls ""stereotypes"" - convenient simplifications.Finally, it may be of interest that ""the drowned and the saved"" was intended by Levi to be the title of his first book, If This is a Man (known in the U.S. as Survival in Auschwitz). His publisher disagreed, although there is a chapter in If This is a Man called Drowned and Saved. Levi's preoccupation with the role in the camp of differences in power, privilege, luck, and alliances-of-convenience runs throughout his work. It is a topic that still deserves much more attention than it has received."

Whether it's Armenians by Turks, Poles by Germans, Soviets by Soviets, Rwandans by Rwandans, Cambodians by Cambodians, Croats by Serbs, Serbs by Croats, Bosniaks by Serbs, Darfuris by Sudanese; the cruelty involved in the murders far outweights the ""reasons"" for the crimes.No matter how angry one is with his fellow human beings, the systematic murder of ones neighbors is unfathomable. The murders in the ex-Yugoslavia are as random and systematic as those by Nazi Germany. Ethnic cleansing (to give it a title like a TV commercial) is no less horrendous than religious zealousness. To search out you fellow human being, and then murder them without rhyme or reason, except for their religion or the language they speak (is Serbo-Croatian that different from Croato-Serbian?) or the religious hierarchy they follow seems as absurd as to murder all the left-handed blonds with blue eyes.Primo Levi spent the forty years after the Holocaust trying to fathom how one (anyone) survived in the ""Lagers"" (his name for the Camps). He was 'lucky' in that he was taken in 1944, when some prisoners were kept for their 'knowledge' as opposed to the immediate extermination of all who came off the trains. But even then, how does one live with the knowledge of what one human being can do to another, sometimes out of no other reason than boredom?What is interesting in this volume is his discussion of the reaction of 'everyday' Germans, to the original volume, ""Survival in Auschwitz"". While most of his letters of from 'young Germans', born during and after The War, those by the older Germans are most enlightening. This book is important in the unbridled descriptions or the uselessness of torments for no use other than the pleasure of the torturers.Zeb Kantrowitz"

What's all the hype? This book was one of the dryest works I've ever been assigned in school, and I struggled to finish it. Levi seems to offer nothing new on the topic, and in fact seems to get lost in half-remembered, or at least half-told, stories of his times in the camps that illuminated nothing.Despite Levi's supposed &quot;respect&quot; for each individual word, I cannot say that a single one in this book left me with any deeper understanding of the concentration camps or his struggles.

His writing is elegant, his language precise. And the distinctions he makes throughout the book, differentiating between types of violence, for example, are vital and sharp. There is much that I loved about this book. The two crucial flaws I see, and these are all the worse considering his precision elsewhere, are a very dangerous anthropocentrism and a just as dangerous ethnocentrism. So far as the former, he consistently speaks of the Jews and others in the camps being treated as &quot;animals.&quot; He doesn't see the irony of having been labeled a subhuman, and thus one who may be (according to the master race) slaughtered, and then using &quot;animals&quot; as a pejorative. Given that our culture is killing the planet because we perceive all nonhumans as &quot;subhumans,&quot; this blindness on his part is dangerous. I probably could have forgiven him this had it been alone, but his ethnocentrism was really appalling. He consistently paints the Holocaust as Unique with a capital U, somehow underplaying the at least one hundred million Africans killed in the slave trade, the tens of millions of indigenous peoples killed in North America, the indigenous peoples being killed today because they're in the way of the &quot;lebensraum&quot; our culture wants, in fact the genocide that characterizes industrial civlization (for a thorough exploration of this, see anything by Ward Churchill, Lewis Mumford's Myth of the Machine, or Zygmunt Bauman's Modernity and the Holocaust). He mentions these other genocides, and seems to give them their due, but then a page later will somehow elevate the Holocaust above them. The ethnocentricity manifests in other ways, too. For example, he talks about how shameful it was to be stripped naked when they first arrived at the camps. He paints this picture vividly and horrifyingly. He should have stopped there, because in his analysis he says things like &quot;Anyone who does not have [clothes] no longer perceives himself as a human being but rather as a worm: naked, slow, ignoble, prone on the ground.&quot; Well, no. Many cultures of indigenous peoples have had traditions where clothes meant little. His categorization would seem to include these indigenous peoples as &quot;worms,&quot; or, once again, subhumans. If you can overlook these deep flaws, you can still learn much from this beautifully-written book."

Chaffey ""beckahi""",7/7,5.0,1218326400,Witnesses for the Lost,"""The Drowned and the Saved"" by Primo Levi, is different in one aspect from his earlier works dealing with his experiences in Auschwitz: in the previous books, he was still an impassioned young man, racing as it was to record his memories and experiences. For later in life, memory can become less exact and true, as he recounts in this book, a collection of reflections and observations about his experiences and what they have to say about that time and humanity in general. ""The Drowned and the Saved"" is a bibliography of sorts, an examination of one man's search to make sense out of the senseless, to open the eyes of those who were not there, to make sure that this horror is never forgotten, or repeated.Primo Levi, while Jewish by birth, was agnostic by the time he was taken as a political prisoner to Auschwitz. He survived, thanks in part to his job as a chemist, but was still just as affected by the savagery around him. Levi explores different topics within the Lagers, and while distanced by time and experience, his observations are still cutting. Levi deftly talks of various topics - the useless violence inflicted upon prisoners, the shame that they felt in their situation, how language itself became degraded within the camp system, and how there are grey areas where blame and judgment are not necessarily easy or concrete. Levi closes his book with a look at correspondence he has received from Germans after the translation of ""Survival in Auschwitz"": almost all of them try to explain away their lack of knowledge and courage, and while Levi may be able to forgive, he isn't able to forget.Primo Levi and other writers who share their experiences about the Holocaust are often referred to as witnesses: but Levi insists that the true witnesses of the darkest horrors are those who did not survive. It is truly impossible to know what their experiences were like because they are not here to tell. Levi also admonishes the easy and placating stereotypes that have arisen in recent times, offering that the actions of the Germans and the world during WWII cannot be judged by the standards of today. ""The Drowned and the Saved"" is an informative and thought-provoking book, offering insights into lessons that should never be forgotten, but existing in a world where this is a very real and terrifying possibility."

Primo Levi did an immeasurable service to western civilization in documenting so eloquently and powerfully his reflections on the greatest crime in human history. A survivor of Auschwitz by a combination of luck and skill (documented with rare clarity and mundane, brutal honesty in Survival at Auschwitz and The Reawakening) Levi returned to his native Italy and his work as a chemist - but he could never forget the horror visited upon himself and millions of others in similar situations. We are fortunate that an intelligent, humanistic mind survived long enough to give us this reminder - Never Again. Sadly, as Levi recognized, even a lesson of this magnitude cannot be wholly learned when good people are willing to stand by and let evil be done. Pol Pot's excesses in Cambodia before Levi's death, the Serbians in ! the former Yugoslovia since Levi's death, are two more examples. In my mind, Levi's body of literature is the defining memorial to the Holocaust, with a greater effect than, for example, the Holocaust Memorial in Washington D.C. (which is actually not a memorial but a timed entry exhibition) or Spielberg's Schindler's List. The moral question - how could any society be responsible for such an unspeakable atrocity against God and their own humanity? - must be addressed with unflinching honesty and clarity. Levi asks that question from a rare vantage point. Sadly, all too few take the time to listen to the answer."
B0006DMK6I,All about marketing in greater Kansas City,,A114YQ7ZT9Y1W5,Steiner,3/3,5.0,1184112000,Astonishing and Vivid,"Primo Levi's final memoir about the Nazi Holocaust is among the most provocative and compelling accounts of the Shoah in the entire literature. Indeed, it is one of the great political memoirs of recent years. Levi was an Italian chemist, anti-Nazi activist, and Jew who was sent to Auschwitz and famously documented the atrocities that he experienced in `Survival at Auschwitz,' one of the first memoirs to be widely read in Germany. This book is a profoundly introspective rumination, not on the particular horrors of the camps, but of their philosophical implications for human beings as a whole. In `The Grey Zone,' Levi explores the moral ambiguity of this moment in history, both in terms of the work of the Kapos and the rare but meaningful resistance from the Germans. Levi is open to the possibility of a moral spectrum, yet he remains unequivocally vociferous in his condemnation of National Socialism, and of the German people's complicity with this movement. There are many striking and haunting moments in `The Drowned and the Saved,' such as Levi's discussion of the Musselman, or the experience of palpable shame on the part of the Jewish victims. This book is a special memoir because Levi refuses to draw the reader via an explicit recollection of the litany of horrors that he experienced, but because he is willing to penetrate into the meaning and truth of the holocaust as human abomination. A true masterpiece, both in approach and in execution."

It is a down-to-earth, very well reasoned history of the various historical tendencies and phenomena that together are called &quot;the industrial revolution&quot;. I cannot vouch for this volume being absolutely correct. The author does not have much time for those who dwell on the evils of industrialization, or who want to include class struggle in their analysis. Though I was not fully convinced of this, still I was willing to listen. Not being an expert in the field, I was looking for a decent explanation or summary of the whole process. I definitely got my money's worth in Ashton's book. It is well-written, without jargon and without presumption of vast historical knowledge on the part of the reader. It gives you an overview of such various fields as population growth, early forms of industry in England, the technical innovations, capital, banking, labor unions, conditions of workers, industrialists' clubs, and relation of agriculture to industry. Though I found the part about banks and interest rather rough going, it was entirely due to my own poor understanding of the field. My edition could have used a map. The shires, the rivers, and the many towns of England are not all imprinted firmly in the brains of North Americans. Other than that, I would heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their understanding of the Industrial Revolution."

(Pg. 14)He states that as with industries making us of ""casual"" labor today, ""more people entered these trades than could be assured of regular work. Underemployment, rather than periodic unemployment, was the bane of the domestic worker."" (Pg. 39)Ashton points out that throughout the 18th century, it was customary for manufacturers to be paid for their goods as long as two years later; but with the speeding up of transport and communciations, ""there was a tendency to shorten the accommodation."" He adds, ""A new sense of time was one of the outstanding psychological features of the industrial revolution."" (Pg. 69)When dealing with the question of child labor, Ashton cautions us, ""The conduct of factory masters must be judged in the light of their own age and of that which preceded it,"" since we now have a standard of life ""immeasurably higher"" than theirs, and we place ""a different value on child life."" (Pg. 79)He perceptively observes, ""It is sometimes suggested that the presence of women in an industry has a humanizing effect on the men who work in it; but one would need to take a very optimistic view of the nature of man to believe that this was true of coal-mining."" (Pg. 83)After noting that not until ""the whole apparatus of government has been drastically reformed and a body fo qualified public servants had been called into being could life in urban areas be other than squalid,"" Ashton summarizes, ""If the industrial revolution was not able to bring its rewards in full measure to the ordinary man and woman it is to the defects of administrative, and not of economic processes, that the failure must be ascribed."" (Pg. 97)Ashton's book is an intriguing and persuasive perspecive on this controversial period."

It is not a politically correct book, often turning traditional accepted beliefs about the industrial revolution on their heads. For example, one of the reasons why many poor families had dingy, windowless dwellings was the window tax charged by the government based on the number of windows in your house. Ventilation and health suffered as a result. Another example is the reason for the shoddy tenements built in the cities experiencing rapid industrial growth. Government rent and building regulations made it awkward to invest capital in housing. As a result, the cities that witnessed the greatest economic growth were often some of the least developed and regulated prior to the Industrial Revolution. In short, this is a well-researched economic history that suggests free markets and property rights as being central to the Industrial Revolution while demonstrating that the government regulations often made things worse for the working poor.

Could there be a greater purpose for the joining of lives? A purpose that could eventually save the lives of hundreds of people? That is what Gary Stewart Branfman has suggested in his book, ""Surreal Eternity"". I believe he has stated his case well. Carole is a Jewish widow and mother of two teenaged boys. She is the Chair ""man"" of the Board of a hospital in New York, her grandfather having started the clinic many years before. She lives in an estate on Long Island. Ha-med is an Arab widower, raising his daughter, Aneesa, with the help of his in-laws. His wife died in childbirth not long after he began working for a prestigious architecture firm in New York City. After five years of mourning her loss, in the gardens of the hospital where she died, he meets an angel. Aneesa is drawn to the beautiful woman, as is Ha-med, and the soulmates recognize each other. Ha-med is the head architect for the hospital's renovations. He has earned this honor, and we learn how goodwill has helped him to achieve this goal. Throughout the story, we learn through flashbacks of Ha-med's life and Carole's, the circumstances that drew them together all along. The author gives insight into these two different cultural backgrounds, through family history and the history of a cruel world. More than that, he gives insight into the true purpose of our ancient religious leader's words. It matters not what religion we follow, so long as the end result is the same...Do unto others as you would have done unto you. There are lessons here for those who need them. Conflicts over religious differences, ignorance, and closed minds are overcome or at least worked through. The characters are strong and represent wisdom through their actions that we can only hope the majority of the world possess. The author's use of a character's history gives depth to the story, to the character's persona and lends substance to the entire novel. The plot is intricate and an example of how fate works its wonders, but proving that we rarely actually understand how synchronicity affects our lives. The plot also demonstrates how our lives affect the lives of so many others, often without our knowledge. On the lighter side, this is a wonderful love story that includes all aspects of family life, from the innocence of a child's understanding of love, to the passion of the honeymoon suite. ""Surreal Eternity"" is a very well done novel."

(Incidentally, I am the mother of seven; grandmother of fourteen; and during the window of opportunity between childbirth and grandchildren, I received my bachelors degree in Social Work).I suggest all my family members read this book. The smooth, articulate way in which Dr. Branfman manages to provide wisdom while covering many pertinent, controversial, and current topics in his short novel is fascinating. Although it is labeled as,'fiction', many situations, places, and anecdotes appear to have historical significance. The smooth transitions from past to present, and from The West Bank to New York are cinema-like. The underlying theme of Surreal Eternity is: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". We can all benefit from hearing this over and over.My only criticism of Surreal Eternity is that it could have been longer. I look foreword to the movie!"

She speaks from her own personal experience and shares the stories that other caregivers have told her. Strong was the first one to write a book that 'tells it like it is.&quot; Her writing brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion because I thought my experiences with an ill husband were unique. This book showed me that I was not alone, where to turn for help in finding support groups, how to handle difficult family situations, and most importantly, gave me hope that I could carry on. Being a caregiver is a very lonely existence...most of the attention focuses on the person who is ill. However, illness impacts the entire family. The healthy or well spouse should not be an invisible part of the equation. Brava to Maggie Strong for her courage and for leading the way on this important topic."
B000OUFHO0,Mainstay,,,,16/16,5.0,909532800,Validation and Practical Help for a Well Spouse,"When my husband was diagnosed with a chronic illness in 1992, I was totally unprepared for the major lifestyle changes that it brought about, even though I am a nurse. When I found &quot;Mainstay&quot;, it was as though I was no longer alone. There was someone who not only understood but who was able to clearly articulate the experience. The illness and the circumstances were different but the feelings were so similar. The book also gives realistic and practical ways to survive as a well spouse. However, for me, the best part was that the book led to an ongoing organization, the Well Spouse Foundation, that continues to provide support, education, and hope to many well spouses."

As the wife of a chronically ill husband, Maggie Strong is honest about her husband's long illness and how it has altered their marriage and their family, and about the feelings all caregivers have: the love, the despair, the humor, the determination to go on and transcend enormous problems. There is nothing depressing here, but no Pollyanna either. You'll also learn about insurance, disability checks, dealing with doctors, asking for help, and scores of other ways to manage. You'll learn about a great support group. This voice will stay with you."

Maggie Strong explores every aspect of the experience, from the first dreadful diagnosis of her mate's emerging disease to the social and emotional changes that inevitably wash over the family's daily routines. And while she never glosses over the terrible toll such an experience can take on every member of the family, she also offers plenty of affirming information on what caregivers can do to save themselves while negotiating these difficult waters. I can't recommend this book enough. Short of knowing Maggie Strong personally, I can't imagine having a better companion for the journey my husband and I must travel. The book has literally saved my life! Thank you, Maggie."

Ross,5/5,5.0,1259020800,A resource which has grown and become even more helpful,"Maggie Strong published this hard hitting, practical guide to spousal care giving almost 20 years ago so that some of the information is now dated, even out of date. As the Well Spouse Association writes: ""Maggie Strong gives us concrete, hard-sought information on depression, impotence, fatigue, downward mobility, isolation, anxiety and the loneliness that can accompany a chronic illness in the family. This book started our Well Spouse Association.""I found her basic approach very helpful when I discovered the book (about ten years after I took on the caregiving role for my wife), especially dealing with lonliness. More to the point, her book led to the creation of an excellent support organization, the Well Spouse Association. We are not devotees of support groups but over the years a number of people have asked our advice on how to deal with various issues, and we've received only positive feedback from our recommendation to contact this group.I have read most of the books that Well Spouse has reviewed favorably, and I've spent a few hours reviewing those that I found of interest and help. They included:A Husband, A Wife, & An Illness: Living Life Beyond Chronic Illnessby Dr. William July. Both husband and wife are professionals and they tell about her illness and their reactions to the challenges from their separate perspectives. "" We were living the American dream when she was struck with a devastating illness. As we forge our path to healing and recovery, we've discovered vital ways to live our lives beyond illness and we want to help you do the same thing."" I found the book and the website too psychologically oriented for my taste, but many people disagree.The Emotional Survival Guide for Caregivers by : Looking After Yourself and Your Family While Helping an Aging Parentby Barry Jacobs. A professional's approach, which appealed to my analytical side. Helpful.A Three Dog Lifeby Abagail Thomas. ""Abigail recounts, not only how she survived the emotional traumas universally experienced by all caregivers, but also how her eventual acceptance of ""this man is not the man I married,"" leads Abigail to a life enriched by new friends and new pursuits imbedded in an independence she never imagined."" Over the years, the Foundation has found that spouses, particularly men, find it hard to accept their new roles. Realizing my wife was ""not the woman I married"" was the biggest single hurdle for me on this journey.The Goldfish Went on Vacation: A Memoir of Loss (and Learning to Tell the Truth about It)by Patty Dann. This book tells about the loss of a spouse with little kids in the family. Ours were seven and three when the tumor appeared, and many of Dann's experiences paralled ours. I'm not sure we did as well as she and her husband did, but we did our best.The Human Side of Cancer: Living with Hope, Coping with Uncertaintyby Dr. Jimmie C. Holland. A very helpful view from a profession at Memorial, one of the great cancer hospitals.The Selfish Pig's Guide to Caringby Hugh Marriott. ""This book is a fantastic read, and it may leave you with some new coping mechanisms, more confidence, and a lot less needless guilt! With great humor and a sharply sarcastic wit, Marriott gets right to the heart of all the difficulties we caregivers encounter - emotionally, financially and physically. If you ever though a nasty thought, lost your temper, felt like you were going insane, felt isolated, friendless, frustrated with bureaucratic idiocy, or wondered why you were being a caregiver in the first place, The Selfish Pig offers understanding, comfort and assurance that you are not alone or insane or a bad person."" (I've written a very positive review of this book as well.)***Two helpful books, both of which I've reviewed here on Amazon, and not reviewed by the Association are:A Family Caregiver Speaks Up: It Doesn't Have to Be This Hard (Capital Cares) (Capital Cares)by Suzanne Geffen Mintz. Suzanne Mintz is president and co-founder of the National Family Caregivers Association, and wrote an earlier edition of this book,Love, Honor and Value: A Family Caregiver Speaks Out About the Choices and Challenges of Caregiving (Capital Cares). The very helpful Appendices and the comprehensive Bibliography have been expanded and updated, and the third chapter on public policy matters has been significantly revised. There is also a good introduction to and description of the Association and its benefits and activities.Uncertain Inheritance, An: Writers on Caring for Familyby Nell Casey. Most of us are amateurs in caring for ill people. As one reviewer wrote, the burden of doing so ""is apt to descend upon us like a blow from fate, stunning and unforeseen. ... [Then] something cracks open -- a father or a friend gets cancer, a mother succumbs to Alzheimer's, a husband has a terrible accident, a child dies -- and what Virginia Woolf once called ""extreme reality"" floods in."" Any one of us can find ourselves unexpectedly tested to the limits of our endurance. The great power of this book is that several people describe their experiences in their own words. You'll find that if the blow from fate descends on you, you'll meet the challenges in your own way.I also learned not to criticize anyone for the way they meet the challenges -- even if they avoid them completely.Any of these books may prove to be helpful if you become a care giver for your spouse.Robert C.

I'm not in her target audience for this book, but I learned so much from it.Like the author's husband Ted, I have had multiple sclerosis for over 20 years. I've written books - i.e. The Art of Getting Well, available on Amazon, which you can read at davidsperorndotcom - about self-care for people with chronic illness. I teach self-care to health professionals and people with illness.But seeing the experience of chronic illness through the well partner's eyes was hard for me. Strong doesn't pull punches - she reports the emotional, physical, social and economic toll of chronic illness on partners and entire families.As a writer, I admire Strong's ability to mix personal stories with scientific information and expert opinion. Even though it's obvious that she knows more than many of the psychologists she interviews, she finds the nuggets of wisdom in therapists' experience and presents them to us. She tells personal stories with the telling details that touch readers' hearts and make the characters vivid.The how-to sections are also excellent. There is information on what skills and attitudes all long-term couples need, and how chronic illness affects them. Her daily check lists - one for the sick person, one for the well spouse - are excellent guides. She provides a guide to using psychotherapy and support groups. Although she reveals her anger, fear and resentment, she does it with tremendous compassion.My one criticism might be that little is said about how to overcome communication problems. Lack of communication caused many difficulties for Maggie and Ted and their children. He was resistant to talking about their issues, but there are probably ways she could have opened him up.I got this book to prepare a book my partner and I are writing for couples with chronic illness. Our workshops for couples focus on sex and intimacy, and Strong doesn't back away from these issues. About having extramarital sex, she doesn't condemn or recommend - she just reports the stories and expert opinion she has learned and leaves it up to us to decide. That is our view too.The first several chapters are unrelievedly sad, as things get worse physically for Ted. But stick with it. It is surprisingly hopeful to the end."

It doesn't take long before they're embroiled in yet another murder, this time involving someone near and very dear to both their hearts. Sarah Abrew, who is 88 years old, claims she committed the crime, but Peter has plenty of doubts. He thinks he knows who did it, but it's how to prove it. All the evidence points to Sarah.

Much of the humor is rooted in his insightful view of life, love, and the seeming futility of it all. Giles Goatboy offers up the microcosm of academia as the stage upon which the Greek tragedy of all our lives is played. The only real redeeming features in Barth's worldview are the laughs he rummages out of the ashes of nihilism, and his wicked, self-deprecating sense of humor. However, his works ultimately offer up a depressingly futile vision of life. His humor makes his perspective palatable, in fact, tasty, but I often find myself hoping that for his sake, Mr. Barth has more hope than his novels portray"
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,A1DMOOFE9R8N5U,Heavy Theta,16/20,5.0,1045526400,A masterful performance.,"It took me a couple of starts to get past the first twenty pages of this book, but the persistence was well repayed. Over the course of a few works (Sot-Weed, End of the Road, Letters) Barth was one of the great powers of modern literature. Goat-Boy finds him in peak form. The longevity of his computer/campus framework, and the wisdom of his ""if it ain't broke"" philosophy are subject to worthy discussion, but anybody who can get away with slapping a Lord Buckley styled hipster take on Oedepus Rex right in the middle just to show off his emense skill is beyond bold. Brazen in all the best ways."
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,A2YUZKPLUYQDKV,Michael Battaglia,25/33,5.0,940118400,Funny but dense,"This was my first exposure to Barth but based on this it certainly won't be my last. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but what I can understand I find myself liking quite a bit. For those who have no idea about this book, it's basically the &quot;quest&quot; of Giles to reprogram the evil WESAC computer that is messing with the New Tammany College campus and even that brief blurb isn't enough to give this book ample justice. The plot is mostly straightforward, to me at least but the layers of satire that wrap around everything give the book greater depth, just when you think you've got it pegged as one thing, Barth gives a sly clue and it all shifts. Is it merely a big joke on the Cold War, or a comment on our culture in general. Or neither. The novel encompasses religion, sex, culture, war, just about everything you can think of and the humor is dark and bitter and at the same time hilariously funny, Giles is the perfect narrator and his observations are both hugely innocent and slyly subversive. The ultimate quest of stopping the computer becomes unimportant when you consider the events that it takes to get there and if there's any book with a more real yet wildly fantastic set of characters, I haven't read it, just when you think that he's treating them all as one big joke, a stray comment or an action reminds you that these are supposed to be real characters. As you can probably tell, this is a novel that you can't go in with any preconceptions, and if you do a lot of it will probably be lost on you. It's a massively dense read and took me almost two months (not because it was difficult, that weird time thing you see) but never once did I think of not finishing it. Definitely worth the time put into it and you can get the time, don't hesitate!"
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,,,12/16,5.0,935971200,He's pushing it,"If I'd picked this book off the shelf having had no familiarity with its author, I have no idea how I would've felt about it. But I was already an enthusiastic fan of The Sot Weed Factor and some of Barth's earlier and later fiction when I read this one, and my knowledge of Barth's astounding narrative and comic capabilities made this book seem a little depressing. Now, I give it 5 stars with no qualms, mostly because of its originality and humor, but I still don't know exactly what to think about it. At the very least, it's something new (even 30 years later) and worth your time. For first-time readers of Barth, however, I strongly suggest The Sot Weed Factor. It isn't as self-indulgent or anti-novel as this one (not that those qualities are necessarily bad in the hands of Barth)."
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,A2D6Z59I34EO17,Richard K. Woodward,5/6,3.0,1256947200,only up to a point,"John Barth is as good a prose stylist as the US has produced, and this book shows it. In the first third or so of the book Barth makes the language cavort, caper, dance, sing. And it is very funny. But unfortunately the joke gets old fairly quickly. The allegory, amusing enough when its underlying conceits are introduced, gets stretched thinner and thinner, to the point where it finally gets agonizing. All through at least the second half of the book I was just waiting for it to end. On the whole, I found two of Barth's other novels,The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, much more rewarding reading, although the prose doesn't quite scintillate the way it does in the early pages of this book. Give it a try, but if at some point you find it getting a bit grating and wonder if it might get better, lay it aside and get something else to read, because it will only get worse."
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,AT2R7ZVT7QYOU,Daniel Myers,5/6,3.0,1208044800,"The ""P"" word","This theological, philosophical, sociological m&eacute;lange of political (Cold War or ""Quiet Riot"") satire, of a sort, wordplay and quasi-Bildungsroman and whatever else it may or may not be, all coded into a cutesy academese, didn't do too much for me---except make me laugh, along with it, not at it.I think one of the other reviewers was spot on in assessing Barth's version of Oedipus Rex, or, excuse, ""Taliped Decanus"", to be the summit of the book. As for the rest of it, I think the best way to read it comes from GGB (the character, not the book) on page 207, in my copy:""It was not my habit to think in a directed manner, but rather to brood on whatever images came to mind as were unbid: not to manipulate and question them, but to attend like an interested spectator their links and twinings...""And brood Barth does upon every philosophical, theological, sociological, political (no doubt I'm leaving something out here) link and twining in the universe or ""University"", but all in good fun with enough high jinks and drollery to keep one turning the pages.Occasionally, Barth will even hit home with a moving passage like the following:""`Anastasia...' The name seemed strange to me now, and her hair's rich smell. What was it I held, and called Anastasia? A slender bagful of meaty pipes and pouches, grown upon with hairs, soaked through with juices, strung up on jointed sticks, the whole thing pushing, squirting, bubbling, flexing, combusting, and respiring in my arms; doomed soon enough to decompose into its elements, yet afflicted in the brief meanwhile with mad imaginings, so that, not content to jelly through the night and meld, ingest, divide, it troubled its sleep with dreams of passedness, of love..."" p.616Read ""blessedness"" for the academese ""passedness"".All things considered (or at least most of them), a jolly fun read, once one has mastered the academese argot. But, really, The Sot-Weed Factor is much more lively and fun and furthermore, not encumbered with quasi-satire and an entire argot to which one must accustom oneself. This book, by comparison, is just too...you know, the ""P"" word."
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,A3OEYWPOPAZB90,nonlinearize,2/2,4.0,1237507200,Awakening the Graduate Within,"Giles Goat Boy is prefaced by 25 pages of introduction, including a disclaimer of sorts by ""The Editors,"" who seek to warn readers that the book they're about to begin is decidedly bawdy, disturbing, irreverent, flabbergasting and probably without literary merit. Though lengthy, these introductions are great fun, and only serve to entice and encourage the already adventurous reader. This is particularly important because the first 100 pages of the book are actually fairly uneventful, a long slow pastoral unfolding of the early episodes in the Goat Boy's life and world. Without the introduction's promises of the mischievous burlesque to come, I might not have kept reading. And that would have been a mistake.The narrative finds its stride when our would-be hero embarks on his inevitable journey, and what had in the early pages been a somewhat awkward and anachronistic style becomes a mythic mode for masterful storytelling. Giles Goat Boy is allegorical epic in which the ""the University"" serves as a microcosm of the universe, and where ""Graduation"" or ""Commencement"" represents some notion of enlightenment, liberation, earthly salvation. Though colored by lively historical satire and heroic farce, the book's themes are ultimately existential, even spiritual.Each of the principal characters seeks to ""Graduate,"" to discover modes of perception and behavior that will enable them to transcend their narcissistic limitations and become fully self-actualized. Their bungling, over-analyzed attempts to untangle repressions and overcome obsessions makes up much of this baffling, hilarious, ribald and psychologically complex tale. The book often reflects the preoccupations of the decade when it was written, and Barth's approach is mostly intellectual. All the while, the pages are littered with surprising insights, delightful mishaps and a certain uncommon wisdom.At its heart, Giles Goat Boy is a zany and uniquely engaging adventure story, one that's playfully aware of it's own symbolism, subtexts and archetypes. In fact Barth seems incapable of leaving any aspect unexamined, and the narrative does get a bit carried away with itself sometimes. In a 2001 Bookworm Interview, Barth admitted that the book is longer than he wishes it was. His undertaking is so provocative and ambitious, however, that like the struggles of its multifaceted characters, the book is remarkable in both its successes and its failures. A Plus!"
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,,,7/11,5.0,837043200,"Like the tide, Bath's stories cleanse and refresh our life","I suppose it is inevitable that, as the post-war boomers approach the big six-zero over the next decade, we will see a tidal flood of tender, soul-searching narratives. Boomers want to understand rather than simply experience life, and most have been frustrated by life's refusal to obey our expectations.John Barth seems to have made such soul searching his life work, and I seem to have followed him book for book, life experience by life experience over the years.A clever &quot;academic&quot; writer (read: &quot;he writes like a dream but his wit sometimes overwhelms the story&quot;), Barth has addressed boomer experience and frailty .Seeming to be five to ten years ahead of boomers, his books have ranged from the tragedy resulting from a terribly botched abortion (long before we openly spoke of this horror), through the visionary and usually misguided quest of the idealist (Sot-Weed Factor and Giles Goatboy), the terrible pain of realizing one is an adult (the clever but exhausting Letters), to more leisurely and accessible mid-life reassessment as protagonists take &quot;voyages&quot; on the emotional seascape of middle age (Sabbatical, Tidewater Tales, Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor, Once upon a Time...).Each five years or so, I eagerly await his newest offering, devour it, and then feel frustrated when his literary games seem to detract from his story.But, then, each time I realize (as if for the first time), the essential nature of his writing. Like the age-old games from which his writings spring (the quest/redemption stories of the Iliad and Oddessy, the &quot;doomed&quot; prophet stories of the Old and New Testaments, the mistaken identity games of Shakespeare and thousands of authors since, and the metaphor of story as voyage and voyage as growth from Chaucer, 1001 Nights, etc), Barth plays his games to remind us that the act of story telling *is* the experience, it *is* the reason we read: the experience of hearing ghost stories around the camp fire remains with us long long after we have forgotten the actual story.And then I remember that, as a reader, I have no more &quot;right&quot; to expect neatness and closure in a Barth story than I have the right to expect neatness and closure in my own life. Try as we might, our own work, our own story is always in progress. And like Barth's beloved Tidewater, the ebb and flow of our own story defies our attempt to capture to master it.In the end, life and Barth's stories remain as delightfully cleansing as the tide itself.KRH www.umeais.maine.edu/~hayward"

One cannot separate this work from the 60's. The whole metaphor upon which the book is based is fairly trite. Of course, if you like ""Earth in the Balance,"" ""The Population Bomb,"" or ""The Sirens of Titan,"" then you'll probably absorb ""Giles Goat Boy"" into your own worldview and then go off on a pacifist riot through San Francisco.Perhaps it is somewhat disappointing to see Barth lay aside his precious nihlism in favor of sweaty luddite pot-philosophy. It is certainly nice to see Barth avoid this tendency in his later works.Compared to the disappointing ""Letters: A Kind of Novel,"" which is artistic to the point of unreadability, or ""Chimera,"" which is lacking in anything but the curiosity of being a Playboy pick, ""Giles Goat Boy"" is irresistably entertaining. The intricacy of the plot is vintage Barth (and of course, the whole ""heroic cycle"" thing is present, if you choose to reflect upon it). At moments (as in The Sot Weed Factor), Barth reveals glimpses of the perversions that he is to reveal more fully in later works (Somebody the Sailor, for example), but they are not as central to the story as they might have been.All told, I would agree with other reviewers and suggest that those new to Barth steer clear of Giles Goat Boy until they have digested some of his other works. It is a fairly useful thing to understand Barth's structural tendencies when reading GGB, and an introductory reading of this book first is too likely to convince the reader that Barth is just another 60's type who writes a good piece of filth."
B000CRFVMI,Giles The Goat Boy,,A2M8XFIIF9GPO5,"Joseph Suglia ""The Greatest Author in the World""",1/4,2.0,1303430400,A review by Dr. Joseph Suglia,"A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaWith his imposing fourth novel, Giles Goat-Boy: or, The Revised New Syllabus (1966), John Barth stopped writing stories and started writing stories-about-stories and stories-inside-of-stories. The ""meta-fictional"" dimensions of the novel are apparent from its first page onward. A ""Publisher's Note"" informs its readers that Giles Goat-Boy is rumored to have been generated by WESCAC, a super-computer that-as one learns later in the text-has ""commenced a life of its own"" [86] and taken over a mythical Super-University. According to the logic of Giles Goat-Boy, the horizons of the University are the horizons of the universe, the ""microcosm"" stands for the ""macrocosm"" (a conceit derived from Joseph Campbell); it stands to reason, then, that WESCAC, having completely taken over the universal University, would have produced the very text that we are reading. This clever ""meta-fictional"" device displaces the individual voice of the author, of course, but also reflects the sources that make its writing possible. If the author wanted to write a work that refers ceaselessly to the conditions of its production, he succeeded. A sprawling epic about mythological heroism in an age of all-consuming computerization, Giles Goat-Boy resembles the infinitely self-referring spreadsheet of a constantly self-renovating and self-activating linguistic super-computer.Giles Goat-Boy is many things. It is a Bildungsroman that charts the gradual socialization of an individual subject. Raised by goats, messianic savage George Giles strives to become the new ""Grand Tutor"" of the University and reprogram WESCAC. In fact, it is George who is reprogrammed. Following the classical form of the Bildungsroman, the novel ends with the disappearance of the hero's identity insofar as he is absorbed into the computer's complex machinery. Deep within Axis Mundi, the belly of the computer, George submits to WESCAC his student identification card. In doing so, he loses his name and remerges as ""The Founder."" Like Wilhelm Meister, George's character is stamped by an external authority that grants him his socially reconstituted selfhood and, thereby, his validity.Giles Goat-Boy is also a complex theological and political allegory. The University is a stage upon which various world-historical conflicts are dramatized and enacted. ""The Quiet Riot"" allegorizes the Cold War. The Campus Riots are the world wars. The Bonifascists represent the National Socialists; the Moishians represent the Jews. The West Campus represents the West; the East Campus represents the East in general and the Soviet Union in particular. WESCAC is the atomic bomb. ""New Tammany College"" represents America. Getting ""flunked"" is equivalent to damnation; passing is equivalent to salvation. The ""Dean O'Flunks"" refers to Satan; the ""Old Founder"" refers to Jehovah. Each of the oppositions mentioned above is dialectically synthesized at the novel's close.Most importantly, however, Giles Goat-Boy is an extraordinarily elaborate practical joke. As with most postmodernist works, the reader doesn't quite know whether to take any of its meanings seriously, but suspects that one shouldn't. Allegory, for instance, is merely one of GGB's many language games. Perhaps one should take ""J.B."" at his word when he says-or is alleged to have said-that ""language is the matter of his books, as much as anything else, and for that reason ought to be `splendrously musicked out'"" [xvi]. Nonetheless, one of its reputed authors maintains that the book should not be dismissed as `a work of fiction': ""Excepting a few `necessary basic artifices'"" Stoker maintains, GGB is ""neither fable nor fictionalized history, but literal truth"" [xi]. This is also doubtful. ""Literal truth"" may not refer to a truth on the other side of language, but rather, a linguistic elaboration or fabrication of truth. ""Literal truth,"" in this context, would be a truth that is composed of letters.Giles Goat Boy is a world of veils and yet these veils do not mask deeper verities. As authoritative as it might appear, GGB abdicates its own presumptions of authority. The ""Publisher's Disclaimer"" disclaims-or, at least, problematizes-all of the book's claims. According to the ""Disclaimer,"" the alleged author, ""J.B."" renounced his authorship. He claimed that he is merely the editor of the manuscript in question, which was tailored by one ""Giles Stoker"" or ""Stoker Giles."" The latter claimed, in turn, that he is the editor of the manuscript, which was manufactured by the automatic computer, WESCAC. The computer also renounces the book's authorship. GGB's authorship, it would seem, is infinitely regressive. No one wants to admit having written the thing.Barth's future meta-narratives (Lost in the Funhouse, Chimera, Letters) will become increasingly more involuted, vine-like, and entangling, increasingly more extravagant, bombastic, and bloated, and increasingly more irritating, self-fascinated, and densely imbricated. Some readers, overpowered by Barth's stale verbiage, will bow to his turgidity. Others will remember, wistfully and nostalgically, Barthes' real masterpiece, The End of the Road -- a sour and cruel novel, to be sure, but also an infinitely more powerful and engaging one than Giles Goat-Boy. Whereas The End of the Road comes about like the shock of a physical hammer-blow, reading Giles Goat-Boy is a bit like having one's mind EAT-en by an all-embracing cybernetic parasite.Dr. Joseph SugliaP.S. I gave this book a rather low rating because of its execrable, nearly unreadable prose style."

Dont remember much about it, but for some reason parts of it have stayed with me, the vision of literary gloss upon gloss recursing to the depths of infinity still surfaces in my consciousness occasionally. Read this about the same time as Vonnegut's 'Sirens of Titan', which, fwiw, was a more influential book for my emerging world-view, and somehow their themes seemed to overlap in visions of futility and complexity. This book probably made me lose any desire to pursue an academic career. Now, at the middling age when i read practically no nonfiction, and all my reading is work-related and hyper-technical, this is one of the nonfiction books i am pondering rereading, along with 'The B! oomer Bible', as examples of books i kind of dismissed at first reading but have somehow stayed with me, and which i feel may have some relevance for the work-aday phase of my life's journey."

Giles must descend into the belly of WESCAC and change its ""AIM"" programming. He is the Grand Tutor, he thinks, as do some others.A recurring concept and concern of this book is the question: does what Christ says indicate that the is the Christ or is whatever Christ says the truth because he is the Christ? In other words, is the yardstick a correct measure because it matches our concepts of inches and feet, or do we assign authority to the yardstick and follow its caprice?I know many people find Barth great fun, and a lark, but to me he is not funny. His message is bleak and amounts to giving a thumbs down to life."

The translation is by the late Cyril W. Beaumont, who at least the older generation will remember as the legendary owner of the book shop in Charing Cross Road, London. Marie Taglioni, generally known as the first dancer who first danced on points - this is not really so, it had become a fashion and was a novelty in the first half of the last century and many dancers attempted it. But this light creature - she was taught by her father and worked enormously hard to acquire that special lightness, is generally known to have introduced dancing on pointes as opposed to mere posing. Of Italian-Polish-Swedish descent, she was born in Stockholm in 1804, but soon left her place of birth, although she did return for guest performances. In her days, she was the absolute super star and this book tells of her career - there are also many interesting illustrations, mainly old lithographs where the artist has taken a good deal of poetic licence, especially with her fantastically slim feet."

Holyoak,37/39,5.0,983404800,Top notch evolution text for the undergraduate student,"EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS (2nd ed) by Freeman and Herron hits the mark for an evolution text for the undergarduate student. It's not so thick that it's intimidating, but the contents cover the basics of evolutionary biology without being watered down.The authors address topics of current interest (e.g., the evolution of HIV in Chapter 1) in drawing the student into the conversation about what evolution is, how it happens, and how you can demonstrate that it is happening.Major sections of the book include the following:1) An introduction to evolution: the HIV story, evidence for evolution, natural selection...2) Mechanisms of evolutionary change: mutation, genetic drift, genetics, etc...3) Adaptation: sexual selection, kin selection, social behavior, life history factors...4) The History of Life: mechanisms of speciation, reconstructing evolutionary trees, origins and evolution of life through human evolution...5) Current Research in Evolutionary Biology: development and evolution (a field that's really gaining momentum these days), molecular evolution, evolution and human health...The authors touch all the important bases in this introductory text on evolution. The organization of material is logical, the tone is professional without being overbearing, there are many understandable examples, and the illustrations are excellent. Because of those factors, this new book appears to be a great text to teach from. There are wonderful reference texts out there about evolution, but most of them are not easy to teach or learn from. This book, however, helps students to learn, and provides ample material for instructors to use.This is now my top choice for a textbook in evolution.

This book is our textbook.The first two chapters are about Darwinism and Evolution. I also read the Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner who is the winner of the Pulitzer Prize. His points about Darwinism and Evolution are all in this textbook with many of graphs and pictures. Although it is a textbook, it's easy to comprehend even if you are not a pre-med student. Topics such as natural selection, microevolution, and irony and controversy of the validity of evolution by natural selection are covered.Part II of the book is about Mutation and Mendelian Genetics. The author covers gene duplication and Yule's Numerical examples, analyzing the point of the natural selection being a potent force of evolution. And sexual selection and adaptations are other important topics that are discussed in the part II.Part III of the book is about current research (1998). Various theories in relationships among humans and the extant apes, and sexual selection are covered in great depth. Again, it all comes down to microevolution and macroevolution and their patterns after examing adaptive radiations, punctuated equilibrium, and fossiles.Lastly, the author talks about social behavior of various species. The author concludes that when individuals interact, four outcomes are possible with respect to fitness: cooperation, altruism, selfishness, and spite. Robert Trivers' theory of altrusim is tested and other &quot;outcomes&quot; about animal behavior are studied. From these studies, the author concludes that genetic variance exists for behavioral traits. &quot;Thh field of behavior genetics is devoted to exploring the extent and nature of this variation. Behavioral geneticists use selection and heritability studies to identify traits with significant genetic variance... and can uncover the specific function of loci influencing social behavior.&quot;I think this book covers many important topics and is easily comprehensible even for non-biology majors."

This one is good only for true fans of the Wizardry series and even then is a weak entry into them."

I would heartily recommend both the beautifully written books in this series as well as the 'Nita and Kit' books'.

I do disagree with some of the other reviews that found this book too drawn-out or some of the plot points contrived. The book built up slowly but steadily, not with as much action as &quot;Night With Moon&quot; but with more detective work on the part of Rhiow, her team, and their new allies -- more the literary equivalent of a good suspense movie than an action-hero one. And also unlike some other reviews, I didn't think the battle with the Lone One was &quot;tacked on&quot; or unnecessary. In fact, it was almost inevitable after the cats foil Her plans for Queen Victoria. Think about it -- if you were a selfish, vindictive Power who was absolutely sure you were going to win, and suddenly your scheme was stopped in its tracks, wouldn't you be furious and decide to rid yourself of the &quot;obstacles&quot; once and for all?

But soon they find that they have more problems than they thought. A technical book has somehow come into the hands of an alternate Victorian England (with some aid from the lone power). Rhiow &amp; company (along with the team of Brit cats) find that they must journey back in time to prevent alternate Q. Victoria's death and recover the tech book, or else that demension will be plunged into nuclear winter; a winter that, due to the ripple effect, could reach into our demension as well. Add to this a possible traitor in the team's midst, the reapearance of Ith (lizard wizard from TBONWM) to help research a desperately needed spell, and Ahru's lost twin sister (if you think they all died in the first book, wait'll you see the nifty explanation) and you have an awesome read. There is even an appearance by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, along with a cute twist to the story about his future. I found this book fun, but it doesn't move with quite the speed of light pace as TBONWM. It is a must to read TBONWM first, as this new book contains several spoilers. This book was slow to get going and seemed to contain some very mundane details. The end is also quite hurried and seems to be quite confusing, although I found some elements of the end quite predictable (but then, I read a lot). It is still a very good book, but I was biased somewhat against it in the first place, in expecting it to be as absolutely awesome as TBONWM. p.s.: Cool Fact: the covers of the books are different and (I think) better in Europe. check out some web pages about the books to see what I mean."

In this story, feline wizard and Worldgate technician Rhiow and the survivors of her team--opera-loving tom Urruah and visionary kitten Arhu--must travel to London to try to repair a malfunctioning gate (cats, unlike humans, can both see and manipulate the ""strings"" that make the gates work). Gradually they discover that an alternate England has been brought into being through the scheming of the Lone Power, and threatens to overwhelm their own reality and end all life on Earth. To prevent it from doing so, they must forestall the assassination of the alternate Queen Victoria in her very bed--and the way they do it could only be accomplished by cats.As always seems to be true in Duane's work, there are touches of tragedy--the fate of the gallant London teamleader Huff and his beloved mate Auhlae may make you reach for the Kleenex box. But her alternate England is splendidly imagined, and there are light moments as well, like Rhiow's reflections on the possibility of finding a mate for her widowed human, Mike. Saurian wizard Ith reappears and performs gallantly, and his and the cats' interaction with a young Arthur Conan Doyle is charming.

Although her book is not an excellent source for Joan of Arc as an biography, Gordon did a good job in informing the readers some rare (instead of popular) historical background during the time as well as Joan's personal motives which contribute to her uprising. It's true that Gordon did not tell a straight forward story about Joan, it does not mean that she is a bad writer who intends to omit important details. In the book she gave a detail chart of dates and events of Joan to compensate the biographical account for Joan (if she did not expose it enough in her book). I am impressed to find that in a short work, Gordon's intensive research on Joan gave vivid, clear, historical and sometimes critical analysis about Joan herself and her actions. Gordon's style is both narrative and analytical. Gordon's book may not an important biography for Joan but it's definitely a wonderful and exciting read for those who wants to know the Joan behind the scenes."

Instead, she tells us what she thinks of Joan of Arc. The book thus fails completely as a biography. In addition, a good deal of what Mary Gordon thinks is, in my opinion, nonsense. In the eleven-page introduction (which precedes only 173 pages of alleged biography), Gordon tells us that Joan ""may be the one person before 1800, with the exception of Jesus Christ, that the average Westerner can name."" I suppose that Joan ""may be"" that person, in the same sense that it ""may be"" that pigs can fly, but I would guess that Shakespeare, Napoleon, Beethoven, and Julius Caesar, among others, would be named by more westerners than Joan of Arc. She devotes sixteen pages to the treatment of Joan of Arc in literature and on film, which would be reasonable if it weren't that it means that sixteen pages less of an already-thin volume are devoted to her life.

She attracted the despise and hatred of many powerful and learned men, was judged by them, defied them, condemned by them, and hideously burned alive. For women, she is an inspiration.

Pouliot,0/0,4.0,1232323200,Captures the contradictions of the cowgirl-turned-warrior (but ditch the audio book),"Mary Gordon's biography of Joan of Arc reminds us of the the reasons that the story of The Maid of Orleans has inspired us -- Christians and non-Christians -- for nearly 600 years. Gordon traces the outlines of the story with a few strokes -- the uneasy domestic life in strife-torn Domremy; the otherwordly voices; the meeting with the Dauphin, the lifting of the siege at Orleans and the road to the coronation in Reims; the military victories and failures; the trial, the stake and subsequent glorification.What stands out is Gordon's attempt to get to the heart of her subject as a person. We see the country girl who was brash, contradictory, intemperate, addicted to action and impatient with ceremony. We also meet the dedicated warrior with a genius for self-presentation, who understood and used the power of symbol and ritual, who wept at the death of friend and foe, and who had the temerity and strength of spirit to challenge and withstand the leading scholarly minds of her day.Basing her story mostly on the best source of first-hand information about Joan -- her own words as found in still-extant records from her ecclesiastical trials -- Gordon provides fascinating glimpses into the person behind the myth. We learn where Joan learned to ride a horse; her bold threats against church reformer Jan Hus; her disregard for chilvalric niceties; her insistence at wearing men's clothing, even when it meant foregoing her beloved sacraments. Gordon's depiction of Joan's militery endeavors is less about strategy and more about lifting the veil on her subject. Bedeviling those who would paint her as a brilliant tactician, Gordon tells how during one of Joan's first battles, English soldiers evaded capture by dressing as priests-- a simple ruse that seems to have fooled the inexperienced soldier.Gordon's forays into psycholanyis are intriguing, but often fall short. Shockingly, she seems to suggest that Joan's identification of her voices as belonging to Saints Michael, Catherine and Margaret was perhaps inflenced by her need at trial for the protection of certain strong, armed saints. While Joan's early testimony about her voices seems to vague (she speaks of them as ""light"" and ""comfort"") the thesis that Joan didn't ID them until 7 years after first hearing them seems forced. Similarly, Gordon's discussion of Joan's virginity completely ignores the prevalence of the cult of the Virgin that was prevalent in Catholic countries in the Middle Ages. It is fashionable nowadays to suggest that choosing virginity allows women a measure of freedom from the limitations placed on them by male-dominated societies. But virginity can also be a choice taken for other reasons: emulation of the Virgin Mary, or even a primal fear of physical intimacy. Strangely, Gordon does not even raise these theses. Gordon also suggests that Joan may have known about the location of the sword that she claimed her voices told her about. By claiming that Joan ""may"" have known about the sword on an unconscious level (!) suggests a level of deception and manipulation the part of the saint that seems out of character with the rest of her life. It's one thing for her to lie to her enemies out of fealty to her king, but this?At the end of the book, Gordon explores some of the artistic responses to Joan's story. Joan has been portrayed as everything from a dreamy, tragic figure to a proto-Marxist. Gordon gives these theatrical depictions (from G. B. Shaw and others) more weight than recent filmed efforts, such as Leili Sobieski's ""Joan of Arc"" and the admittedly execrable ""The Messenger."" These, Gordon dismisses with hardly a second look. Yet for its shortcomings, it's Sobieski's TV miniseries Joan that was the most far-reaching vehicle for her telling her story.I was particularlyy interested in Gordon's discussion of the the case for the Catholic Church's canonization of Joan, 500 years after her birth. To see the Church stretch and trim the real Joan into a pure and unblemished icon is to see he truth being violated in unseemingly ways. The Church needed an icon of medieval sanctity in its doomed fight against Modernism. Give me the brassy, arrogant cowgirl any day.Though I would not make Gordon's version of the story the only Joan biography I read, its many stengths (and even its well-meant failings) make it a more-than-worthwhile read. Gordon's Joan is always young, with all of the virtues and vanities of the young. She is full of youthful boasting and valor, and more than willing to see her enemies (English and Burgundian) in the black and white terms common to youth. She is both reverent and uncompromising in her petulance at antagonistic Church officials. She urges a weak and reluctant king to reclaim his kingdom, yet is susceptible to the most transparent trickery. Gordon may not have succeeded in plumbing the depths of her hero, but hers is an honest attempt to limn her with modern eyes.The audio fiascoSadly, the audio version of the book is impossibly irrititing. Narrator Mari Bevon has a wonderful and expressive voice and lends a dramatic approach to reading the material. But she sems to have misreprsented herself as a person who can read French. Her attempts to render short sentences were incomprehensible to this French speaker. She takes wild stabs at French words like ""ecorcheur"" (literally ""scorcher"" or marauder, anglicizable as ""ay-kor-SHAR"") and gives us, inexplicably, ""ay-ko-RAY."" This is careless and sloppy reading to say the least!And her trouble constant mispronuciation of French town names, though sadly typical, was irritating. Reims becomes ""Rimes"", Compiegne becomes ""Com-pig-nay"" or ""Compignon""; Vaucouleurs becomes ""Vow-coo-lace"" and Rouen becomes ""Ruin"" or ""Rowan."" Her pronuniations of French proper names also grates. Poor Alencon! He is dyslexically ""Alsenon"" and ""Alksenon."" And the Dauphin, who appears throughout the book, is a ""Doff-een"".Worse, though, Bevon seems flummoxed by uncommon English words. ""Otiose"" is rendered ""oh-toyce""; Saint Joan endures ""canization""; Christ is whipped ith ""scrouges"", not scourges; papal legates are ""leh-jeets""; ""Joanolators,"" those who make an idol of Joan, are ""Jan-o-layters""; palatable become ""palpitable""; ""men-sickant"" monks roam the land; condemned criminals are ""un-shryven"". Abstemious and intransigent Joan becomes ""abtentious"" and shows ""intransience"". And her ""synesthetic"" experience of lending light to her voices becomes ""synthesetic."" And where she cannot mangle words, Bevon does the unimaginable, and substitutes -- turning ""insignificant"" into ""insufficient."" Not satified to mispronouce words, Bevon smears the boundaries between the two languages, giving a French cast to perfectly good English words. ""Burgundian"" is gallicized into oblivion as ""bour-gohn-dien"". ""Retinue"" is ""retinyay""; ""province"" is ""Provence"" and Agincourt is An-gick-court. These bizarre errors do little to reflect on the care of the editors at Penguin Books, or on Bevon's intelligence or literary experience.

This turned out not to be the case at all.With the exception of the final thirty pages, the book is a very clear presentation of the facts of Joan's life with enough commentary to make her come alive as a genuine person, not just the mythical figure I knew before reading the book. Above all, the author conveys that Joan of Arc doesn't fit in a tidy little box, no matter how hard some people have tried to make her do so."

The book is an account of the lives and legends of a medieval teenager, who either did or did not hear heavenly voices, and who was either a brilliantly intuitive military leader or else a glorified flag girl.Gordon's credulous tone is aggravated in the audio version by Mari Devon's breathy interpretation. Devon treats the listeners like small children, giving her high-pitched voice feigned expressions of amusement, awe, and despair. 'After THAT, JO-oan was known as the MA-AI-AI-D of Or-lay-OHHHHNZ.'"

Harry returns to live with his father in the Sidney suburbs. His GI Joe dad, known for drinking beer with a straw due to a World War II injury, obtains a job for his son as a reporter with the Herald. While working there, Harry falls in love with Lucy Whitmoor. They share a seven-year affair while he observes the deterioration of his father.When Joe dies, Harry feels alone and withdraws emotionally from everyone including Lucy. This ends their relationship as she can no longer reach him. Lucy leaves Sydney carrying Harry's child. When she returns she informs Harry she gave up their child for adoption. Harry needs to know why, but the truth may prove more devastating then he will ever want to see.Thomas Moran leaves no rock unturned with this insightful look from within of an ""emotionally blind"" person that seems more like an everyman ""nowhere man"". By the time Harry learns the meaning of life, he is too acrimoniously human. The story line is told from Harry's Monday morning perspective as he begins to understand what he lost. WHAT HARRY SAW is well written and as deep and baring as a tale can be, but should carry a warning label that this is also as sobering as any novel has been in years. The light at the end of the tunnel is an on rushing train fueled by despair and hopelessness.Harriet Klausner"

0866568689,When Husbands Come Out of the Closet (Haworth Women's Studies),62.5,A26OE9FWOZJBOS,M. Croucher,2/2,3.0,1214784000,Hopeful and helpful but realistic.,"This book is a scholarly yet warm account of a therapist-academic's research into the experiences of straight women married to gay men who had 'come out'. I review it as a gay man and academic mental health worker who has been married. Although over 100 women's stories were sampled for the author's study, only around 30 were interviewed and studied in depth. This needs to be remembered in terms of the findings' generalisability.The cultural context of the book is its most important limitation in my view, as it is embedded in a large-city American culture of the 80s in which support groups and personal therapy were perfectly normal and generally available, and gay married men and their straight wives were part of a different age and cultural cohort than current generations. However, it is not surprising that the stories of these people, faithfully and sensitively recorded by the author, ring true despite the book's publication nearly twenty years ago in 1989. Rather than being distracted by some of the specific advice in the book, if one can listen to these stories and to the author's perceptions that have emerged from her experience of providing therapy for people then the messages in the book are more timeless.Some will find the scholarly tone difficult to read but the language itself is clear. More ruthless editing would have made the book more accessible to less confident readers but if you bite off single chapters or parts of chapters and digest them more slowly the whole book is still palatable.People with a moral viewpoint that precludes any open marital arrangement will be disappointed that no stories of enduring and strong marriages between straight women and 'out' but not homosexually active gay men are reported. Perhaps this is because such arrangements are not ultimately successful in most instances. Rather than criticising the author for this, I think we should remember that this was a convenience sample of wives and their marriages. It would appear that if there are significant numbers of marriages that stay together with the gay man remaining sexually faithful, such people do not come forward to participate in studies like this, at least in the America of the 80s.What this book does best is to provide a support for coping and for understanding the traumas of husbands coming out in a hetero marriage, based upon thoughtful clinical practice and ultimately on the stories of the women involved in the study. As such, I thought it was hopeful and helpful for both women and men to read. It is not a guide to making your marriage succesful, still less a guide to successful separation. However, it may help you to move along either path more confidently or to support someone else who is travelling this difficult journey."

It's a fairly advanced book, if you don't know what a phylum is or what natural selection is you'll probably find it a very rough go. However you don't have to be an expert, I'm certainly not, to enjoy it and learn from it.The book starts off by covering a lot of background biology. The first chapter covers very basic topics relating to classifying animals such as: what phyla are, why it's useful to study homologues, the nature of hierarchies and cladistics.The second chapter covers cellular biology. This quickly moves from the study of single cells to how cells aggregate to form tissues, organs and other body parts. This sets the stage for the following chapters that discuss body plans and how their development is determined by a system of regulatory genes, not just individual alleles.Following this is a discussion of the fossil record, a high level view of the phyla and how they are related to each other. Much of the rest of the book is spent elaborating on this material.The first section concludes with a discussion of the Cambrian Explosion. The main ideas he describes are: there was no explosion, it was due to physical changes in the environment, it was due to a biological changes in the environment or it was due to an intrinsic evolutionary change. Needles to say it's an open question and the author couldn't give a definitive answer. As more material is covered the question is addressed several times later in the book.This first part of the book alone made it worth it to me.The next six chapters form the heart of the book, they give a very detailed account of the phyla. More than just a catalog, it presents how the phyla are related to each other and how they are broken up into subphyla and classes. The evidence from the fossil record is continually presented and details of the body plans of the phyla are illustrated with specific examples. The level of detail is fantastic.Give the title there probably isn't much of a chance that someone would pick this book up for a casual read. It's even more rigorous and complete than I expected. However, there is a lot of background material (which is quite interesting in its own right) and things are pretty much explained from the ground up. The bits of humor in the book were enjoyable, I especially appreciated the dig at postmodernism on page 78. A non-expert, like me, can benefit from reading this book and enjoy it too, but should be ready for a tough read (for me the most difficult part was the vast amount of terminology, but the glossary helped to offset that). I would expect that people with more expertise will likely enjoy it even more."

No, I didn't READ it, I studied it. That's what is required. My little corner of biology is not evolutionary biology, so this book was a bit off my beaten track. For those with the determination, this is a very rewarding work, and may become a classic. It lacks a good glossary; the one it has seems to have been thrown together as an afterthought. The illustrations could benefit from serious upgrading. Yet with these minor faults, I still rate this book as 5 stars. A truly marvelous work."

Valentine embraces these fields with his experience and authority as a professor emeritus of integrative biology at UCB, who has been publishing novel and provocative ideas on the origin and nature of phyla for more than 30 years. This book is essentially about the Cambrian radiation, the event that gave rise to most of the major animal groups. The book's particular strength is its integration of data from paleontology and biology. This book is a remarkable achievement, a timely synthesis of the current state of this exciting field.

The author does not take any controversial positions, and discusses the uncertainties where they are. He provides what i think is an excellent basic review of the biology necessary to understand the book, although when reading a book that is on a subject that is not unfamiliar it is always difficult to judge how easy it would be for someone with less knowledge on the subject. Even though the paperback version being sold is july 2006, it is impossible to have a review that is entirely to the date. If you read source articles you will realize that mitochondrial DNA studies fairly convincingly place placazoa basal to porifera, and a new molecular analysis places urochordates closer to craniata (vertebrata)than cephalochordata, but i am not aware of any summary that includes info that new."

Yardley was a smart kid who learned the basics of hard-nosed poker from his poker sensei Monty. In later years after I had begun to play poker, I remembered Yardley's book and reread it, this time for his sage advice.

In one instance he tells of his schoolboy ""gang"" constructing a giant slingshot in the forks of a tree to guard their headquarters.

The author's affectionate parents are still wedded to their Victorian upbringing, while Frank and his young friends are treading a rocky path between the idealism of the nineteenth century and the exciting unknowns of a new era.

Yes: war is war and people should expect to get hurt. Yes: Both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian stand-off have suffered from acts of terrorism and it serves no purpose to compare wounds, the dead are dead, we don't need any more. However, this book is a very important research tool for one reason. Unlike the terrorist acts that have been committed by both sides in this pathetic tragedy. This book lists actions that were carried out by the Israeli GOVERNMENT, and which they do not deny. War is war, we expect to hear about violence and inhumanity. This is systematic, the book chronicles a policy that began during a war and is still occurring today despite the Oslo accord and numerous agreements entered into by the Israeli GOVERNMENT. Terrorism and broken treaties are to be expected from people who have been raised with an agenda of hate; wether they be the perrennially armed settlers or the fanatical terrorist groups. What should NOT be considered normal is when these acts are committed by a government, acknowledged and excused. Again I repeat, the Israeli government does NOT deny that these actions were taken. In addition, no one can deny the since the Oslo accord- during &quot;peace&quot; time, Israeli settlements in PALESTINIAN areas have increased by over 50%. Don't believe me if u don't want to, the world is full of libraries, go out and do some research. Finally, with regards to the book, it is a good research tool, containing many statistics and accurate descriptions of places, however, that is all it contains. It is far more useful as an aid when reading accounts ar articles as it can help verify information. however, it is not a history of the missing Palestinian villages and should not be read as such."

It is a voice of truth against a decades long propoganda campaign which wishes to pretend that Palestinians didn't have homes or villages within what is now Israel. Khalidi catalogs hundreds of villages which are now gone. Gone as a result of Israel's extensive efforts after 1948 to erase every trace, with explosives and excavators, of the villages. Even with the extensive catalog of information presented, there are those who are in denial. They start with dishonest works that claim what is now Israel was empty when they arrived. Since it was empty, the villages destroyed were simply empty ruins. Lies build on lies.The first british count of the population of Palestine after they took over showed around 80,000 jews and around 700,000 who were not Jews. Khalidi shows the reality of those 700,000 people and their lives. And how the evidence of that reality was erased.Many will be angry that Israeli pseudo-scholars and pseudo-scholarship which has definitively ""proved"" that what is now Israel was empty before Jewish settlers arrived is not accepted as fact. But they have little to be angry about considering that their scholarship has no crediblity outside of Israel and the US Christian Right. The grim reality as shown by Walid Khalidi in this book is impossible to dismiss because the truth of it is right there on the page. No matter how many books they can find to say that what is now Israel was empty of people, every census and what physical evidence is left proves them wrong.Khalidi will also by some be said to be ungreatful to the British and the Jewish settlers. Along with the arguments that palestinians didn't exist and their villages were not real, is the sick idea (refuted by the book) that Palestinians were little more than savages whose only possiblity of advancement was by being civilized by europeans. They fail often to understand that slaves don't enjoy the benefits of progress created by their masters. In the end, they can only repeat the official line that these people didn't exist or were shiftless drifters who have no attachment to any land.Khalidi provides in the book detailed surveys of villages lost in 1948. He has unearthed masses of documentation and photographs. The material shows the existance and life of these villages. What is presented will never be good enough for some critics. All that can be said is that we fortunate that so much survives considering the lengths that Israel went to after 1948 to erase even the rubble of these villages from the face of the earth.Finally, Khalidi shows with Israeli documents how Israeli policies in 1948 led to the depopulation of the villages. It must always be remembered that Israel could only exist as a democracy after 1948 by driving enough palestinians from their homes during the war. The massacre of civilianssuch as Dier Yassein and other policies drove these people from their homes and the borders drawn after the war did not let them come back.Khalidi's evidence for the obvious, the existance of pre-1948 Palestinians, is so overwhelming that no honest person could deny the reality of what he presents. But the enemies of peace in the middle east will even in spite of all of Khalidi's material deny the truth."

Lappen,2/3,1.0,1064188800,Terribly misleading,"This book is extremely misleading. In sections respectively labeled ""occupation"" and ""depopulation, he lists and describes 418 villages, implying that in 1948, Israel forced Arabs from their homes and villages at gunpoint. At that time, however, thousands of ruins, abandoned during the Ottoman era, remained dotting Israel's countryside, according to Moshe Brawer's 1994 Israel Affairs review of the work.Four years before Israel's War of Independence, a detailed study based on British Survey of Palestine maps listed 2,077 abandoned rural villages, hamlets and smaller sites--against only 1,274 inhabited Arab, Jewish and other villages and hamlets, some of them temporary.Furthermore, Dr. Robinson's 1841 book, Journal of Travels in the Year 1838 and H.B. Tristram's 633-page Land of Israel (1865), detail earthquakes, droughts, conscriptions, onerous taxes, internal wars, thievery, malaria, cholera and other epidemics that depopulated much of Israel long before 1880, when the first wave of Jewish immigration began. It's disturbing that a work touted as a great academic achievement includes none of these facts.Khalidi also omits the commonality of Ottoman depopulation programs. In Chio (Greece), Damascus, Hasbeiya and Aleppo, non-Muslims were slaughtered in 1822, 1858, 1859 and 1860. In southern Syria (as it was then called), the Turks conscripted all available youths and extorted ""annual tax of several piastres for every fruit-tree from the very year it is planted,"" according to Tristram, even for olive trees that took 40 years to produce fruit. He and Robinson found Israel barren and empty, its villages poor--and frequently abandoned. In Tiberias, ""almost exclusively a Jewish town,"" the Muslim quarter was in 1865 ""almost wholly in ruins, having been overthrown in the great earthquake of 1837.""A true academic masterpiece would have at least referred to prior devastation and justified the conclusions made in spite of it. Khalidi fails this test, failing to remark (as well) that Schwobel in 1904 found, against 329 inhabited rural Galilee areas, some 460 ruined villages and hamlets. Finally, Khalidi misses another study, which determined that Ottoman rule brought devastation and abandonment to at least 50% of Hebron area villages and hamlets, 26-27% near Tulkarem and Nablus and 85% in Lower eastern Galilee and the central Jordan Valley.The missing long-term perspective is bad enough, but equally disappointing is Khalidi's avoidance of the benefits that Arab labor derived from three decades of British administration (1918-48) and Jewish immigration, which together brought law, order, vital services, economic investment and modernization to the land. From 1922 to 1947, Jewish agricultural settlements increased coastal plain citrus groves 971%, to 75,000 acres. No mention of that, or of the masses of workers these groves attracted from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Arabia--according to Arthur Ruppin, Bill Farrell, Justin McCarthy, Yehoshua Porath, Alexander Schlolch, Neville Mandel, Vital Cuinet and official Ottoman data. This is a significant omission since workers lived in temporary shacks on land they didn't own, and in 1948 abandonned them precisely because they were not permanent.Topping that is the failure to improve upon Arif al-Arif's 1950s historical-political study and personal archives. Alas, Khalidi's long, virulently anti-Israel introduction is followed by 418 sadly inaccurate surveys with only rough sketch-maps and photographs as backup. Although he lists each area's geographical attributes, history, distance from district capital, average elevation, land ownership, use, population and dwellings in 1931 and 1944, the blurred photographs could have been taken almost anywhere, including current-day West Bank villages.There are also blatant inaccuracies. Khalidi calls Fardisiya and Khirbat al-Buri villages. In 1945, Fardisiya (2.5 kilometres south of Tulkarem) had 20 inhabitants who owned less than 20 acres and four small buildings. This was a village? Furthermore, Fardisyia was not conquered, but was ceded to Israel under the 1949 armistice. For Khirbat al-Burj, 34 kilometres south of Haifa, Khalidi lists no population, but states that residents owned less than 4 acres. Air photos show two stone buildings and some hovels. Again, a village?In 1948, there were early 1940s British Royal Air Force photos showing sizes and numbers of houses, cultivated lands and villages. Israel supplemented these that year with high quality air photos of most rural areas involved in the war. The British Survey of Palestine included many detailed maps of villages later devastated. Until 1947, village headmen often kept population, economic and special event data in village notebooks. Israeli academics have also contributed substantial scholarship. But Khalidi did not consult any of the available data, including material declassified in the 1980s. He simply labeled these items ""not available.""Worse, Khalidi employs the flawed Mandate government Village Statistics 1945--which reflects exaggerations by which headmen enhanced government food rations. He also relies on a Beirut reproduction, whose editor further embellished the initial over-counts. The original categorized land ownership as ""Arab, Jewish or others."" Beirut editor Sami Hadawi disingenuously shifted all non-Jewish land--including churches, monasteries, institutions and organizations--to Arabs. Khalidi unreservedly repeats this deception, Brawer reports.And finally, Khalidi omits or grossly misrepresents war-related factors that contributed to 1948 depopulation. He often reproduces portions of Israeli reports--out of context--solely to lay blame on Israel. He nowhere mentions Arab villagers' major war contributions, or the locations of villages relative to their grueling, months-long assault on Israel's roads.If the evidence was so overwhelming, why couldn't Khalidi obtain first-hand material from villagers who lived through these events?Overall, a major disappointment.--Alyssa A.

He edited an earlier version consisting of 52 sections down to 33 sections, the omitted 19 sections were considered inferior and of a spurious nature. The 33 sections were divided into the inner chapters (seven sections), outer chapters (15 sections) and miscellaneous chapters (11 sections.).The inner chapters the Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu) are considered to be the most authentic chapters and most likely to have been written by Zhuangzi or at least written by a brilliant and keen mind. (The inner chapters probably date to around the second century BCE.) The inner chapters contain all the important ideas and are consistently brilliant. The outer and miscellaneous chapters are more uneven and sometimes contain excellent pieces of philosophical writing and others times are the work of a feeble scribbler--to quote the famous Chinese translator Arthur Waley.QUALITY and READABILITY of GRAHAM'S TRANSLATIONFrom the above, one can see why the late sinologist Angus Graham wisely chose to only translate the inner chapters of Zhuangzi. However, at least two things are essential for a good translation, capturing the meaning and getting the flow. If a translation sounds awkward or is not otherwise enjoyable to read it is not a successful translation.This translation is more suitable for a scholar as it is uses terminology that is technically precise, but arcane and awkward in many places. The style of this translation is very academic. It is written by a scholar who appears to subscribe to the notion that any word that is close enough in meaning is the word to use regardless of how it sounds to the reader or what images it invokes in the reader's mind. If one has handy a good English dictionary and is willing to read Graham's end notes the meaning will become clear, but this kind of reading is not an enjoyable experience as the wit, energy and spirit of Chuang Tzu is diminished by this style of translation.The more I translate Chuang Tzu, the less I like Graham's translation. His translations often significantly differ from Watson's and others translators. He makes many unusual translation choices.I recommend that unless you are writing an academic paper on Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi), are a philologist, or are taking a class on Chinese philosophy to skip this translation. (Note, Angus Graham also wrote a second book detailing his translation notes for this book. Again this is only suitable for a scholar, not for the non academic.)ALTERNATE AVAILABLE TRANSLATIONSBurton Watson's translation is superior in capturing the exuberance of Chuang Tzu. The few ""mistakes"" Watson makes are inconsequential as he truly captures the essential meaning and the spirit and the flow of the writing. I highly recommend Burton Watson's translation in either his book: The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu (a full translation) or his smaller paperback: Chuang Tzu--Basic Writings. (This last is a subset of the most interesting and best written parts of Chuang Tzu, and it includes all the inner chapters.)If one wants a more poetic translation suitable for random daily study or meditation then one should seriously consider Thomas Merton's translation of selected passages of Chuang Tzu. They are very well done. And despite the fact that Thomas Merton did not know Chinese, pretty faithful to the original text. The only drawback to his book--and this is its strength as well--is that the selections tends to be short and sometimes he omits passages that are logically and thematically connected and hence probably should not have been omitted. With few exceptions Thomas Merton's selections are the cream of Chuang Tzu. Very occasionally, Merton adds in something that is not in the original Chinese, but he does it so skillfully that it reads like something that Chuang Tzu could and even should have written.I have read (and am inclined to agree) that Arthur Waley's selected translations of Chuang Tzu in his book: Three Ways of Thought are the best written, however Waley only translated some of Chuang Tzu.COMPARISON BETWEEN GRAHAM'S and WATSON'S TRANSLATIONThe late Angus Graham was a respected sinologist, so it is surprising that his translation is flawed, both in its readability and in my opinion in the accuracy of the translation itself. Compare Graham's translation of chapter three, section three, with Burton Watson's.Graham'sMy life flows between confines, but knowledge has no confines. If we use the confined to follow the unconfined, there is danger that the flow will cease; and when it ceases, to exercise knowledge is purest danger....Three years more and I never saw an ox as a whole. Nowadays, I am in touch through the daemonic in me, and do not look with the eye. With the senses I know where to stop, the daemonic I desire to run its course. I rely on Heaven's structuring, cleave along the main seams, let myself be guided by the cavities, go by what is inherently so.Watson'sYour life has a limit but knowledge has none. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger. If you understand this and still strive for knowledge, you will be in danger for certain!...After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now---now I go at it by spirit and don't look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and follow things as they are."

And the question that A. C. Graham's 'Chuang-Tzu - The Inner Chapters' raises in an acute form is this: Do you want to read Chuang Tzu himself? Or do you want to study what a scholarly mind thinks about him, and in the process have your mind carefully adjusted so that you will end up thinking in the same way too?In other words, are you a mature and sensible person with an enquiring mind, who for some reason or other has become interested in China's most brilliant philosophical rascal - one who would have let out a howl of laughter if shown the present book? Or are you a student being run through society's ideological mill, and one needing to grub up on the history of Chinese philosophy and Chuang Tzu's relation to the Mohists and Logicians and other such extraneous stuff, a mill for whom Chuang Tzu is just another 'philosopher' (a word that hardly describes him since he's something much bigger)?If you are one of the latter, perhaps Graham, who is one of the world's foremost Sinologists and a brilliant translator, is the man for you. So far as Graham is concerned, and many agree, most of the received text of Chuang Tzu wasn't written by Chuang Tzu at all. He feels that only the first seven chapters, the 'Inner Chapters,' are Chuang Tzu's own work, the other chapters being a collection of pieces written by others, and in his edition has rearranged the text to bring it into line with his thesis.Consequently his book falls into six parts: 1. Introduction; 2. The Inner Chapters and related passages; 3. A 'School of Chuang-tzu' selection; 4. The essays of the Primitivists; 5. The Yangist miscellany; 6. The Syncretist writings.The 40-page Introduction is both detailed and informative. Each of the remaining six parts has its own introductory note, and is annotated with other long notes. The book is rounded out with a List of Chinese Characters (sinographs) and an Index. All in all, then, this is a thorough and scholarly production in which Graham presents a very persuasive and convincing case for his complex rearrangement of Chuang Tzu's text, and one backed up by lots of impeccably logical argument.So why did I say it would have made Chuang Tzu howl with laughter? Well, because Graham's rationalist approach violates the whole spirit of Chuang Tzu, a man who had seen through the folly of the overemphasis on reason. Graham founds himself squarely in reason, while failing to note that reason can never really arrive at the truth. Chuang Tzu, in contrast, and although he was certainly capable of a reasonable use of reason, was more a bubbling and sparkling fountain of joyous insights, brilliant insights into the nature of man and woman and reality, and he doesn't need any commentators. All you need to read him is a mind of your own.Confronted by the kind of mindset represented by Graham, we should never forget what Lu Chi (+ 754-805) reminds us of in his brilliant 'Essay on Literature,' the 'Wen fu,' when he tells us that: 'Theses are convincing - but deceptive...' I can just see Chuang Tzu smiling and nodding his head in approval.So if you are a student, and if you need a heavily annotated scholarly (though rearranged) translation because you have to grub up for an exam on Chinese Philosophy, Graham's edition can certainly be recommended. Others, however, who may be approaching Chuang Tzu for the first time, would be wiser to look for something less cluttered, something that allows them more immediate access to this scintillating writer without the distractions of a mass of extraneous matter. Two uncluttered and excellent translations that can be strongly recommended are those of Lin Yutang and Burton Watson.And for the simplest and easiest approach of all to Chuang Tzu there is Thomas Merton's quite brilliant reworking and abridgement, 'The Way of Chuang Tzu.' Merton, who was not a scholar of Chinese, may not have given us Chuang Tzu's actual words in his selection of these ironic, witty, and sophisticated stories. But as a man of insight he's succeeded wonderfully in capturing the spirit of the old rascal.Purists may scowl, but I think I spot Chuang Tzu looking down from his dragon as it flaps him across the heavens, and beaming and nodding in approval of Merton too."

Although less well known outside of China than &quot;Lao Tzu,&quot; the reputed author of the _Tao Te Ching_, Chuang Tzu, who lived in the 4th century B.C., is both one of history's greatest anti-rationalist philosophers and one of the best prose stylist of world literature. Among the most famous (and moving) passages in his eponymous work is the story of how Chuang Tzu (whose full name is Chuang Chou) dreamed he was a butterfly, and, upon awakening, &quot;does not know whether he is Chou who dreams he is a butterfly or a butterfly who dreams he is Chou.&quot;Graham gives a complete translation of the &quot;Inner Chapters,&quot; which are regarded by many scholars as the authentic works of Chuang Tzu, and also gives selections from later Taoist works, attributed to Chuang Tzu (but probably from other philosophers). Graham's interpretive Introduction (with sections on such tasty topics as &quot;Rejection of Logic&quot; and &quot;Death and Mutilation&quot;) is itself one of the classic interpretations of Chuang Tzu's philosophy.Readers familiar with the _Chuang Tzu_ from other translations will notice that Graham has rearranged some sections of the text. This is not mere whim on Graham's part, but part of his thoughtful view that parts of the text have been moved from their original locations due to textual corruption as the book was recopied by generations of scribes.As you can see, this book is currently out of print (which is a testament to both the poor taste of much of the book-buying public, and to the near-sightedness of publishers). I sincerely hope that some publisher will pick up the rights to this outstanding translation.Other excellent translations of the _Chuang Tzu_ include those by Burton Watson, _Chuang Tzu: Basic Writings_, and Victor Mair, _Wandering on the Way_. Two fine collections of interpretive essays on Chuang Tzu's thought are Paul Kjellberg and Philip J. Ivanhoe, eds., _Essays on Skepticism, Relativism, and Ethics in the Zhuangzi_, and Victor Mair, ed., _Experimental Essays on Chuang-tzu_."
B0006D8SKK,Choice behavior in rats on resetting concurrent interval and concurrent ratio schedules of reinforcement,,A3JJUCA6K4P31H,Elliot Knapp,5/5,4.0,1208908800,Fantastic commentary; not a good introduction to Chuang Tzu,"I recently finished reading the last of three translations of the Chuang Tzu, which is one of my favorite (if not my all-time favorite) texts. If you've never read it, I politely urge you to run as quickly as you can to your nearest bookstore (or use Amazon--cheaper, but your gratification will not be instant) and pick up a copy of Burton Watson'sChuang Tzu: Basic Writings, which includes the text's most famous and vibrant passages and is, in my opinion, the best English translation of this life-altering text. If you HAVE read the Chuang Tzu and have already been bewitched by the mind-blowing wisdom of its authors, I humbly recommend A.C. Graham's translation as the most philosophically-rigorous translation I've come across to date. Graham's introduction and individual chapter introductions are surprisingly insightful and very helpful for grasping Chuang Tzu's ideas, as well as the less, shall we say ""Chuang Tzu-ian"" ideas that are expressed in the Outer and Miscellaneous chapters.I first decided to read Graham's translation of this text because I'd read his excellent complete translation of theLieh-Tzu, one of the lesser Taoist classics. Although I found the actual translation in the Lieh Tzu to be much more impressive and readable, I found Graham's commentary on the Chuang Tzu to be excellent and fresh. Most translations of the Chuang Tzu have an obligatory and tedious introduction that attempts to place Chuang Tzu as a historical personage and feebly extrapolate facts about his life from the little and unreliable information we know about him. Graham's not off the hook--his translation has this in its introduction--but it also has six different sections that preface the types of ideas that will be dealt with in the text, and provide excellent preparation for the reader's understanding of the following text. Likewise, each and every chapter (often each and every section within each chapter) includes a clarifying introduction from Graham. I find these to be invaluable--though it may seem like overkill (more on that later), these introductions are excellent tools for understanding, and Graham's treatment of the philosophy fills a void somewhat lacking in other translations. These are especially useful when reading the Outer and Miscellaneous chapters--rather than trying to reconcile their confusing and contradictory philosophy with the Inner chapters, I find that Graham's commentary helps me better understand these chapters for what they are. If you want to really understand the different types of philosophy at work in the Chuang Tzu as a whole (not just the famous Inner chapters sections), there's no better translation than Graham's.Despite his philosophical rigor, Graham's translation has numerous weaknesses. As other reviews have noted, he rearranges the text at whim, reorganizing it so that each chapter contains passages of like philosophy. This is very helpful for analyzing the ideas, but it shows a bit of academic arrogance and truly disrupts the flow of a text that has been in the same form for around 2000 years. By rearranging the sections, Graham messes with the synergy present in the traditional arrangement (sort of like music track sequencing--classic album vs. greatest hits collection), and restricts the ideas in each section to the philosophical subheading he's chosen, rather than allowing the reader's imagination to draw its own connections. Likewise, Graham can sometimes be TOO philosophically rigorous for his own good--he brings with him 3000 years of philosophical tradition, often comparing Chuang Tzu's philosophy with that of unrelated classical European philosophers, or applying modern philosophical theory to the Chuang Tzu. In this way, he really misses the point--the Chuang Tzu was never meant to be a systematic philosophical system. It's just a collection of wisdom, anecdotes, observations, and ideas--of course it's not going to hold up to a modern philosopher's inspection! This over-scrupulousness also tends to gut the spirit of Chuang Tzu's mission. In the process of logically-mapping Chuang Tzu's ideas and systematically pursuing the rationality behind his philosophy, Graham acts like the rationalists that Chuang Tzu is constantly making fun of--not to mention the fact that he ignores the mystical nature of the Chuang Tzu; it's not about creating a watertight philosophical argument, it's about experiencing the awe-inspiring power and feeling of the Tao, which is beyond tidy summation in words and philosophy. Graham's philosophical acuity neatly cuts off any path the reader may have followed to use Chuang Tzu's writings as a springboard for understanding and experiencing the Tao in a similarly ecstatic, mystical, and perhaps irrational way. Chuang Tzu's point is that the Tao is ultimately beyond human rationality--Graham forgets this and tries to restrict Chuang Tzu's admittedly limited attempts to describe the Tao to human rationality.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Graham's translation is generally difficult to read and lacks the eloquence or flow found in the other two versions I've read (Watson'sThe Complete Works of Chuang Tzu, and Mair'sWandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu). Even a quick glance at the chapter titles will leave fans of Chuang Tzu wondering why he chooses the wording he does. More often than not, his pursuit of philosophical accuracy (which is so helpful in the introductions) makes the text unreadable--case in point, Chapter 2, ""The Sorting Which Evens Things Out,"" is so cluttered with explicit technical language that you can hardly imagine what it must have been like when it was an idea in the head of the real person who wrote it--Burton Watson's translation reads much more like a person sitting in front of you, using words and hand gestures to act out his ideas and make you understand.In the end, though I've criticized Graham's translation a lot, I really love it. It's just not easy reading. If you're willing to put in the extra effort and really concentrate on it, this book can enhance your understanding of Chuang Tzu's thought AND your readings of other, more linguistically eloquent translations (I still wish I could get Watson's translation with Graham's commentaries!). If only one translation is indispensable, though, I'd have to say it's Watson's Complete Works of Chuang Tzu."

How is one to do equal justice to Chuang-tzu as a philosopher and as a poet? Most versions show a bias towards one side or the other. A primarily literary translator (such as Giles or Watson) will probably have some liking for the Taoist view of life but also a Taoist distaste for the analysis of concepts, without which he cannot select and manipulate his English equivalents effectively. More intellectual translators (such as Legge, or the great historian of Chinese philosophy Fung Yu-lan, who published a version of the Inner chapters) are inclined to neglect the literary aspect as though it were mere decoration of the ideas. But a Taoist is a thinker who despises thoughts, yet values, and finds the imagery and rhythm to convey, any spontaneously emerging process of thinking which he senses is orienting him in the direction of the Way. My own private final test of whether translation is really working is whether it catches any of the extraordinary rhythmic energy of Chuang-tzu's writing, not merely for the lift of the heart which it gives but because to lose it falsifies the pace and shifts and stresses of his thinking.In the Chinese original the thinker and the poet are one."" Page 33""Cook Ting was carving an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As his hand slapped, shoulder lunged, foot stamped, knee crooked, with a hiss! with a thud! the brandished blade as it sliced never missed the rhythm, now in time with the Mulberry Forest dance, now with an orchestra playing the Ching-shou."" Page 63"" ... With his outrageous opinions, reckless words, extravagant formulations, he was sometimes too free but was not partisan, he did not show things from one particular point of view. .. He thought that `spillover' saying lets the stream find its own channels, that `weighty' saying is the most genuine, that saying `from a lodging-place' widens the range. Alone with the quintessential-and-daemonic in heaven and earth he went to and fro, but was not arrogant towards the myriad things. He did not make demands with a `That's it, that's not', and so he got along with conventional people.Although his writings are extraordinary there is no harm in their oddities. Although his formulations are irregular, their enigmas deserve consideration. What is solid in them we cannot do without. Above, he roamed with the maker of things; below, he made friends with those for whom life and death are externals and there is neither end nor beginning. As for the Root, he opened it up in all its comprehensiveness, ran riot in the vastness of its depths; as for the Ancestor, it may be said that by being in tune he withdrew all the way back to it. However, when one assents to transformation and is released from things, the body has not exhausted its pattern, having come it will not be shaken off. Abstruse! Obscure! A man who did not succeed in getting it all."" Page 283New to Chuang tzu? Read Graham for the exhilaration he brings. Long familiar with Chuang tzu? Read Graham to refresh your vital energy."

Reading other translations I had the sense of glimpsing an important thinker, a sceptical mystic and writer of great humour. However the Chuang-tzu I encountered seemed to depend upon the translation I was using. He is always seen darkly; and in most translations I have read his thoughts are, in places, rendered incomprehensible; whole passages which are so obscure as to be little more than background noise.In this regard Graham's achievement is monumental. His translation aims for sparse clarity over poetry; and his full introduction and regular annotation act as a much needed guide through the brambles of Chuang-tzu's thought. The re-arrangement of the text, while upsetting for some, worked well for me - many parts of the text that I had ill-understood became far clearer when placed in different contexts. [NB while the title is the 'Chuang-tzu, The Inner Chapters', in fact nearly four fifths of the text is present here].Two warnings:i) Chuang-tzu himself held a deep suspicion of the single point of view. The sheer power of Graham's work hides a danger in this regard. I would strongly recommend that Graham's version of Chuang-tzu is read in conjunction with others. It would be a mistake to see Graham's work as definitive. I would also agree with other reviews that this is not a good place to begin a study of Chuang-tzu.ii) Those whose interest in Chuang-tzu is mystical/religious, or are interested in Taoism as praxis, will probably find this work too stuffy for their tastes. This is an academic work, and so contains all the virtues and vices of arm-chair philosophy, it is well informed and admirably clear but on the other hand it lacks the poetic soul which make other translations more 'spiritually' satisfyingHaving said that for anyone interested in the philosophy of Chuang-tzu in the context of axial age China, you could not find a better base text to work from."

Burton Watson is lively, but he flattens the text: it is all one style.

The publication provides an English translation together with the Latin text on facing pages. More than 200 page of commentary were added to the 1983 edition, providing paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of Duns Scotus's reasoning following the text. Unfortunately, the quality of the binding of my copy was not very good. The book began to fall apart almost as soon as I opened it. However, there is no other publisher providing anything comparable.

Most of the books about the encyclical are slanted to the left, written by the same theologians and moralists that the Holy Father is warning the Bishops to reign in. Not so with this book. The contributors, who include Frs. Avery Dulles SJ, Romanus Cessario OP, J. A. DeNoia OP, Servais Pinckaers OP and Mr. Alasdair MacIntyre, are faithful Catholic theologians who write from a viewpoint of appreciation for the Holy Father's teaching.The book is divided into three parts: Perspectives on the encyclical, Issues raised within the encyclical, and the Reception of the encyclical. The Perspectives section is aimed at helping the reader to unpack the structure and meaning of the encyclical itself. The Issues section discusses in-depth the different questions that the Holy Father has addressed, from Natural Law to the true meaning of freedom to the concept of moral absolutes within a relativistic society. The third section has two essays that examine the press and the academic commentaries that were published within the first five years of the encyclical's publication. Finally, Pio Cardinal Laghi, the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, provides a reflection on how Veritatis Splendor can be used within the educational environment to teach moral theology.This is a superb book to read alongside the encyclical, especially when the technical language begins to weary. The subtitle, &quot;Studies by Ten Outstanding Scholars&quot;, is quite an apt description of the contents of the book. As Fr. Servais Pinckaers explains in his essay, Veritatis Splendor is truly an &quot;Encyclical for the future&quot;. This book will help mine the riches present in the Holy Father's teaching."

What the author offer is literally a phenomenological exploration into the heart of darkness of modern combat, one into which young soldiers have been sucked into the vortex of the experience with wildly inaccurate and romanticized notions regarding their own fallacious expectations of the experience. As the dust jacket appropriately remarks, this is a journey into the hearts and minds of the average soldier, in Korea, Vietnam and since, and shows how popular ""John Wayne"" colorized fictions set our kids up for a fateful slam into the brick wall of a much more horrible reality. Thus, beginning with such unrealistic ideas of what to expect, Kindsvatter argues quite forcefully that such inaccurate conceptualizations aided the solders in creating what he refers to as a ""fictionalized"" set of images of war.Therefore, despite the relatively intensive military training the young recruits received, the author contends nothing could succeed in disabusing them of these fallacious notions or completely prepare them for the horror of actual combat. The nature of that combat, with its extreme emotional stress, physical hardships, and bloodthirsty graphics, spawned a kind of emotional syndrome that the author argues progresses fairly predictably from initial shock and disbelief through a period of confusion toward a perpetual state of much more hyperawareness, a state in which their immediate performance becomes maximal while the effects on their long-term mental health becomes progressively more dangerous. Critical to the success of this progression of this 'pilgrim's progress' from disbelief through confusion and into a battle-weary hyper-vigilance was the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers, their belief systems, and each soldier's individual will to survive. Obviously, Kindsvatter observes, in situations such as Vietnam, where the belief systems came into serious question both within the ranks and in the culture back home, successful maintenance of this state of combat readiness was more and more imperiled.What the author contends is that once such belief systems are destroyed, few things can repair or sustain them. For some, the excitement of battle turns them into ""combat junkies"", and it is these guys who may succeed in surviving only to find readjustment to civil society later is extremely hazardous. For the majority, it was integration into the unit and the friendships within it that sustained them, and allowed them to continue under some of the most extreme continuing conditions modern humans can experience. Yet eventually, for most soldiers the ability to function slowly eroded, to the point that many casualties occurred for ""burned out"" grunts who had more than enough savvy to protect themselves, but who has lost the kind of emotional edge they needed to continue. In these cases, many of them suffered emotional breakdowns and/or total physical exhaustion. This is an important book, and one that anyone with either a friend or relative in the military would do well to read. I hope it gains wider readership, as it is a serious, enlightened, and worthwhile entry into the field of military history. Enjoy!"

To me, Elswyth Thane's non-Williamsburg books read like screenplays, and this one more than any other.Story: a young woman (the gentle, unfurled bud, Joanna) writes to a famous author, Eve Endicott (is that name 1950's or what?!), and bemoans the rigid, confined existence imposed upon her by her autocratic, irrational father. Eve Endicott writes back and is quickly drawn into Joanna's life.There are three possible heroes to Eve's heroine (no spoilers here :) ). The story flits from mid-Manhattan to moneyed Connecticut neighborhoods, replete with cocktails, supernatural speculation, and smooth cars. There are a few comic, touching, and romantic moments laced through the plot. Picture Cary Grant, Ray Milland, Gary Cooper, Loretta Young, and any ing&eacute;nue type. That's the time period. Tryst, this book is not. The profound commitment, the passion, the sustained devotion that are Thane trademarks are not here, but Letter to a Stranger is an interesting rounding out of the Thane collection."

There is certainly good reason why this work was reprinted in no less than ten editions. Yes, it is a bit dated (original 1921) but it is a work of HISTORY, and not, at least directly, a commentary on the present state of education. It is indeed a product of a different age - an age before field specialization and politically correct prose, when it was still possible for a scholar to present an eminently readable, grand overview of the past.The authors' discussion of education in ancient Greece alone makes this book worthy of a read. They explain, for example, how Socrates and other Sophists challenged the educational traditions of Athens. Through the efforts of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, among others, Athens became a center of critical thinking of the region. These Athenians taught that knowledge was a prerequisite of virtue. The effect of this philosophy was to challenge political institutions of the region.In the spirit of the early philosophers, Boyd and King believe that a proper understanding of the Western traditions of education will help promote a good society."

I guess the Torah/Bible, which originated in the Middle East, isn't something secular scholars know of or concern themselves with;many would refer to it as the basis for &quot;Western&quot; thought. They also rely on long-refuted racial categories, talking about how &quot;Aryan&quot; invaders molded Greece into something important. The book obviously has not been updated enough through the years in order to keep up with science. It also makes little attempt to study modern education, as current issues like vouchers and charters get overlooked.

It saved my life! You won't find the detail and specificity of this one in any other of Fairclough's works, which are mainly conclusive but not detailed when it comes to specific texts.This book focuses on text analysis, which is a part of Fairclough's wider development for a methodology of social research, called critical discourse analysis (CDA).Fairclough's argument for including detailed text analysis in his project, is that, contrary to a widely-spread tradition inspired by the works of Foucault, that mainly relies on social theory for analysing discourse, discourse analysts shouldn't be limited to the traditional ways of theoretical social research, but instead they should be able to oscillate between the analysis at an abstract, structural level (orders of discourse) and what happens in particular texts.With the help of work from various authors, such as Pierre Bourdieu, L. Chouliaraki, A. Giddens, J. Habbermans, M. Hallyday, and many others, Fairclough develops the framework of detailed linguistic analysis of texts, explaining first that there are three types of expressing meaning: Action, Representation and Identities, which can be unfold respectively in terms of the different Genres, Discourses and Styles that are present on discourses.The book addresses each one of these aspects, along with examples from texts of public domain (interviews, political discourses, advertisements), covering selected social research issues, such as discourse in new capitalism, governance, social structures, hegemony, legitimation, etc. In particular, fairclough shows how linguistic and grammatical features in particular texts account for evidence of the different purposes and constructed meanings, not easily spotted at first sight.A good source for students and researches in language and discourse, interested in processes of meaning making and social construction."

So it is quite an accomplishment to write a novel that so quickly and deftly turned my sympathies and interests towards a previously unliked character.Aiken's Jane Fairfax fleshes out the childhood histories of both leading ladies (Emma and Jane), and fills in the back story of their relationship and temperaments.It is fascinating to read the story that takes place prior to the time period where 'Emma' is focused, but even more interesting to read the shifted perspective once the two storylines sync up.Finally, the book is so well-written, so closely adhering to Jane Austen's own style, that you can convince yourself you are reading a long lost manuscript from Austen herself. And as the tale unfolds, and Jane's perspective reveals more of Emma's character than we even knew before, Austen's 'Emma' becomes an even better realized, more ironic, and wryer look at social folly.I definitely recommend this novel to any Austen fan, particularly those familiar with 'Emma.'"

On the other hand, I was somewhat wary given how much I love Emma and Austen in general and was afraid that I would find it lacking in both style and substance. In the end, I was terribly impressed by Aiken's work and enjoyed this version tremendously.Joan Aiken explores the events in Jane Fairfax's life that take place outside of Highbury and the sphere of Emma. What we once saw only through Emma and the others thus takes on a completely different dimension, particularly the circumstances that appear such a surprise in Austen's novel. The new characters are very well-rounded, realistic and fascinating while the 'old' ones remain very much true to their roles Emma, even down to their language, mannerisms, dress and so forth.Despite how well-written and fascinating I found the book - and how good the descriptions, characterizations and scenery are - I never felt quite like I was reading Austen. But I was so impressed by how close Aiken did get to the original, and here her extraordinary skill as a writer is obvious, I believe it is more a matter of my degree of familiarity with Emma and with Austen's work in general than any inherent flaw in the book. Although I do believe Jane Fairfax is good enough to stand on its own, I think that in order to enjoy Jane Fairfax fully a reader must be relatively familiar with Emma, for having seen the story before from another perspective is an enormous part of the appeal. I would recommend this book to any fans of Emma or Austen - or really anyone interested in a well-told and excellently written story - with the caveat that the book be appreciated for what it is and not compared to minutely to the original."

The characters and plot are flawless; it was very enjoyable to have these beloved characters rounded out and delved into more, and Aiken accomplishes her most difficult task -- making Frank Churchill sympathetic and therefore worthy of Miss Fairfax's regard. I was thrilled by the time I got to part two, which begins and ends on the same timeline as 'Emma' -- for instance, do you remember when Jane accompanies her aunt, Miss Bates, to Hartfield in order to thank Emma and her father for the quarter-section of pork, and they bring the news that Mr. Elton has become engaged to someone in Bath? Well, here you are in the room when Jane and her aunt first get the news as they are leaving for Hartfield -- it is delicious! There are many such overlaps, and all are delightful. There are also lots of commas and semi-colons and other such idiosyncracies found in the works of Austen and her contemporaries, and the style rings true. I would say it comes very close to being an Austen novel, and is one of the best of the Austen homages, but the humor of Austen is not here. Also, the novel is so well-done that I would have enjoyed an account of events after the original timeline. One does want to know that Jane is happy and Frank is true and Emma's friendship continues.... Still, a very satisfying read, and I will definitely read more works by this author."

It is wonderful to be inside her head and find out why she had a secret engagement with Frank Churchill. She is such a sweet and endearing heroine, and in addition she is strong, intelligent, and loving. You will grow to like her and grow to dislike Emma. Which makes you wonder, isn't that the way it is supposed to be? Jane Austen's own words were that she created a character that no one but herself will like.

Most of them are copied directly from one JA novel or another (you can recognize Robert Ferrears, Lucy Steele, Mrs Ferrars or Lady Catherine etc. with different names) but without any success at breathing life into them.Emma is shown at her worst, Frank Churchill is without any charm and so on...

You could understand and sympathize with her much more though given less information than here.Alas - this ""more information"" is what totally destroys the book, for the background that is given as Jane's story is so downright stupid and incredible, so totally out of character with her that I threw up my hands in desperation several times.

Every reader who read Emma with just a little attention is aware of the fact that Jane Farifax is so upright and honest that nothing but the deepest love would have induced her to accept such an offer - here she does not seem to care about him at all.And don't even get me started on Jane having a crush on Mr Knightley. Ugh!If you feel like you have to read this book then try to borrow it from your local library, but don't waste money on it, it's not worth it!"

Chaffey ""beckahi""",5/5,4.0,1126137600,The Secret Keepers,"As a fan of Jane Austen, I am often curious about authors who use her characters as spin-offs for their writings. ""Jane Fairfax"", by Joan Aiken, is a commendable look into the life of the little-known character from Jane Austen's ""Emma"". Austen devotes little time to Jane Fairfax, the young woman destined to be a governess who forms a secret engagement to Frank Churchill; but Joan Aiken takes readers into the background of this fictional character, from youth to marriage, with generally pleasant but uneven storytelling.In ""Jane Fairfax"" we are introduced to a young Jane of about six years old. Destined to befriend the rich Emma Woodhouse, Jane dreams of a close relationship, but these are dashed by Emma's snobbish and superior attitude. Jane is taken to live with the Campbells, friends of her deceased father, and is brought up as their second daughter, enjoying a sisterly relationship with Rachel Campbell. It is through the Campbells that she first encounters Frank Churchill and agrees to a secret engagement before she makes her return to Highbury; this proves difficult for Jane who is now unaccustomed to the ways of Highbury, how every word and action are watched and nothing remains secret for long.Joan Aiken doesn't quite deliver on the premise of ""Jane Fairfax"". While she does an admirable job of fleshing out Jane's early life and her inner thoughts, the pace is uneven. Lengthy amounts of narrative are devoted to frivilous stories while her attachment with Frank and the denouement of the book happen at a lightning speed. She spends a good section of the book on Jane's childhood, but quickly passes over five years in two paragraphs. There even seemed to be a four page spell when Mr. Knightley was narrating the story rather than Jane. I enjoyed the book since I love the characters Jane Austen created in ""Emma"", but by no means should this be considered the definitive look into the life of Jane Fairfax."

Circus the leader of the gang brought up the bear the whole gang was quiet as a church mouse. Then they heard a big branch snap they all turned white. One of the many reasons i liked this book is because once you picked it up you cant put it back down. Cicus is my favorite character because he came from a bad backroud and he had the easy way to go down the wrong paths, but he got saved by the Lord and he took the right paths. When he told his alcohloic dad that he was saved by the Lord his dad rushed to get saved by the lord. When they were both saved they both hugged and cryied. The scene that I liked the most was ehn the book decribed everybody and their backrounds,The question that I has was why didnt the gang tell it to their parents."
1562764764,Pcweek How to Implement Microsoft Nt Server 4.0,,A1L5RDC8H9BB9S,"Ben Rothke ""Information security professional""",4/4,4.0,972864000,Good place to start learning about Windows NT,"Mark Twain once said that he did not have enough time to write short stories, so he was forced to write long novels. There seems to be a lot of Mark Twain wannabes writing computer books these days. Perusing the latest NT titles, one gets the feeling that there is an unwritten requirement that technical books must be at least 3 inches thick.Many NT books that claim to cover numerous topics come in at well over 1200 pages. Not only do such books kills a lot of trees, they also are rather difficult to read while standing on a bus or subway.How to Implement Microsoft Windows NT Server 4 humbly comes in at a rather modest 425 pages (or about 3 pounds). Rather than trying to cover every imaginable feature of NT, it assumes that the reader has a substantial level of NT knowledge and is geared for more of an advanced user, as opposed to one that needs 20 pages of screen shots on how to install a printer driver.The book is divided into 8 parts, compromising 39 chapters and 5 appendixes. As stated earlier, the book get to the heart of the technical issue at hand, rather than spending scores of pages on a relatively simply idea. Some chapters are as short as 2 pages, sparing you the often unneeded screen-captures than can add up to over 50% of a books page count.Parts 1 -2 (chapters 1-10) deal with the initial setting-up and configuration of an NT server. One of the enigmas of NT is that it is so easy to set-up, that inexperienced administrators can often set-up a system in a manner that later does not work or scale well. The authors write that no matter how good or easy Windows NT Server is to use, it still is a complex operating system. Given that caveat, throughout the book, it notes crucial areas in the installation and configuration process where utmost caution is required.An interesting point brought up in chapter six is about the infamous Intel Pentium bug. For the vast preponderance of NT Servers, the presence of a defective Pentium processor will have no effect. This obviously can not be said for a workstation, but for an NT Server, there is little point in attempting to fix the problem via software. For those users that somehow feel the need to perform this fix on a server, the author's write that the work-around may even harm system performance. The bottom line: Apply those patches carefully and selectively.Parts 3-4 of the book (chapters 11-25) accomplish in a little over 100 pages what other books take over 500 pages to state. These chapters detail the bulk of the configuration of an NT Server. Chapter 22 provides an excellent overview of the issues involved with directory replication. NT has the ability to replicate directories and data across servers. Replication is one of those little used, yet powerful features of NT. Don't get all excited and throw out your copy of ArcServe, replication is meant only to copy specific directories and was never meant to replace an enterprise-wide backup solution.Knowing that NT servers do not exist in a vacuum, Part 5 enumerates how NT can co-exist with other network operating systems. There is a good overview on how to configure NT to operate with Novell NetWare, and for those Microsoft bigots, how to migrate from NetWare to NT.One of the key selling features of NT is its bundling of Remote Access Services (RAS). RAS is both powerful &amp; (when it works) easy to setup. Part 6 takes about 35 pages to go over the RAS topics.Part 7 specifies the particulars of setting up NT for the Internet. It details the native Internet services available to NT and how the Internet Information Server operates. Other peripheral issues such as web page creation, configuration DCHP, DNS &amp; WINS are dealt with.Part 8 ends the book with every NT geeks favorite section, how to tune and tweak NT for maximum performance. If you are into topics such as how to set threads, processor priority resolution and pagefile optimization, you will love this chapter. The five bottlenecks of system performance are revealed.As stated at the beginning of this review, the benefit of this book is its scope. This book is not for everyone. If you desire a title that will walk you through all of the steps involved in a specific process and the secondary minutiae, this is not the title for you. This is not a &quot;for dummies&quot; type of book. It is written for the accomplished to expert level of user. And for those types of system administrators, they will really appreciate it, and how you don't need a U-Haul to carry it around."

In a rural setting, with average people, a horror comes visiting. A stranger in a coffin-like box that he promises never to leave, if he can only park in their yard, garden, or barn. Although Kard may be strange, he may not be entirely a stranger.For $100 a week, Jim Douglas and his friends, living in a rural area near Claremore, Okla., agree to let Kard stay in corners of their properties. Inside the box, nothing is visible except Kard, in his jogging outfit, and blackness behind him, punctuated by small pinpoints of white light.In spite of his promise to never leave the box, his presence begins to intrude into their lives. Suddenly his image appears on the children's computer monitor. Deborah Douglas is sure that she knows him from somewhere, sometime, and the possibility that she remembers him, seems to disturb Kard. Then, people begin disappearing. The reality of what's inside the box must be determined before the Douglases and their friends can rid themselves of Kard's presence. But the stranger is in control and they don't know how to fight him.Readers who enjoy this and other of Wooley's horror novels might also enjoy Ash Wednesday and Soul Storm by Chet Williamson."

I found this to be an utterly fresh horror novel, a new approach for a new century. Wooley sets his tale along America's backroads, where danger spreads like the latest craze, unchecked by city suspicions. It's a brilliantly apt metaphor for the creeping change that takes us all unaware and corrupts our freedom. Wooley's unique voice lends his story a powerful sense of place. His vivid characters are a constant delight, drawn with unfailing wit and humanity. The conflicts they struggle with are as much within themselves as with the sinister Man in the Box, so I was always wondering what they would do next. As it speeds toward its devastating finale, this ultra-modern blend of new world tech and old world wisdom seems to ask a discomfiting question: Can we resist what we can't understand?"

Showing clearly that Liberation Theology excessively focuses on social revolution, Nunez shows that the classic usage of the OT Exodus by the likes of Gutierrez is not true to the NT interpretation of this event.He takes us through the two over=riding themes of the need for liberation from any form of oppression, be it religious, political, economic, social. The second theme is that this theology comes from the oppressed and is focused on relief from this oppression.Such views reduces sin to an inherent evil within society, not a society composed of individual sinners. While Christianity surely does and must aid those who are poor and help the structuring of soceity so that justice is for all, the starting point for all theology must be the inspired Word of God.Rather than the oppressed reflecting on their situation, the Word of God must be brought not to the the oppressed situation but to those oppressed and oppressive as well.'Excellent intro to the field."

082481942X,Tea of the Sages: The Art of Sencha,,A1DQI454X335OU,Chris Cochrane,18/18,5.0,975283200,Revealing Chinese Influence on Japanese Art through Tea,"Breaking new ground while covering subjects others have glossed over,this engaging book clarifies influences of sencha tea enthusiasts onJapanese art. As the author unravels the historical conditions andcultural factors related to tea aesthetics, the reader recognizes howcompeting influences affected the consumption of art for elite teaconnoisseurs. These aesthetics eventually drew interest from abroader public.The presently more popular _chanoyu_&quot;whisked&quot; tea ceremony has received much more focus thansencha tea ceremony and practices in Western publications. WithChinese symbolism so commonly found among Japanese art objects,however, it would be hard to understand the quiet taste of chanoyufully informing the creators of Japanese artifacts-- especially sincethe Edo period. Graham's book resolves that puzzle.Ostensibly thebook is about _sencha_ &quot;steeped&quot; tea and its various rolesfor the artistic elite of Japan since its introduction from China.More importantly, the author captures the artistic environment ofJapan since the early Edo period. The book offers a context againstwhich all Japanese arts can be gauged. At times, Japanese art hasleaned toward interest in elite Chinese culture and at other times haspurposively rejected that influence. This book explains that ebb andflow capturing not only sencha tea's influence but also theneo-Confucian influences introduced by the Tokugawa shogunate andenlarged by often-iconoclastic Japanese literati.The book might becompared to Clunas's _Superfluous Things_ text on Chinese Ming taste.Both offer extraordinary insight to understanding Asian art by lookingfrom a perspective that has seldom been studied in detail. Graham isnot the first to speak of sencha tea as promoted by the Obaku sect ofZen monks and by _bunjincha_ literati as influential to Japanese art.She is the first to deeply explore it, put it in perspective and tonot discount its continuing influence.As an aside to the book'sfocus on tea aesthetics, it offer considerable insight to otherJapanese arts by sharing information on sencha tea enthusiasts whohave made hugely significant contributions. Ishikawa Jozan(1583-1672), the monk Ingen (1592-1673) and the literati artist RaiSan'yo (1780-1832) are among these. Each reader will uncover forhimself individuals who may be known by other arts but were informedin sharing sencha tea with their coterie of friends.Other authorshave discussed sencha tea enthusiasts' influence on Japanese art.Stephen Addiss's insightful book _The Art of Zen_ describes severalObaku monks' influence on Japanese painting in extraordinarydetail. Katie Jones, Brian Harkins &amp; Paul Moss (international artdealers based in London) have published catalogs commenting ondistinctive art objects chosen by _bunjincha_ (Japanese literati whopracticed sencha tea-- especially in the 18th and 19th centuries).They note objects that often express the Chinese sage's taste forcommunion with nature. Sencha tea is discussed in the PLW Arts' book_Tetsubin_ as many of these iron kettles were produced as sencha teautensils. For a broad understanding sencha tea's influence, however,Graham's book leads the field.Of the several chanoyu (vs. senchatea) books available on Japanese tea aesthetic, I would recommend SenSoshitsu's. They include _Chado: The Japanese Way of Tea_, _TheJapanese Way of Tea: From Its Origins in China to Sen Rikyu_,_Chanoyu: The Urasenke Tradition of Tea_ and _Tea Life, TeaMind_. These are each well constructed and offer separate insights.The overview of tea history in _Chado_ is a jewel in conciselyexpressing chanoyu aesthetics, but in devoting over 60% of the book tothe detailed ritual steps of modern Urasenke practice, it may not beyour &quot;cuppa'.&quot; The less popular (by Amazon.com salesfigures) _The Japanese Way of Tea_ is Shoshitsu's closest equivalentto Graham's book in expressing the contributions of tea to Japaneseculture. Its chapters on Murata Juko, Takeno Joo &amp; Sen Rikyu areeasily worth the book's price, and early tea history information isdetailed. _Chanoyu_ is a little more expensive but offers anintroduction to tea utensils with great photos that makes it warmlyappealing. _Tea Life, Tea Mind_ required bursting many of its pagesthat had not been fully separated at their top by the publisher.

For starters, the first half of the book is like the movie, but better! All of the author's descriptions are so rich and vivid that I feel like I can visualize exactly what he wanted me to.And then the story continues where the movies ends, properly (not like that terrible sequel movie.) The second half of the story is incredibly polarizing though; if you don't like comeuppance heroes or protagonists who fall from grace, you won't like it. But I love it. The author isn't afraid to make Bastian an reprehensible twit drunk on his own power, and then he successfully brings the character back from the brink. It's a difficult thing to do, and it's masterfully done.So I can definitely recommend this book for everyone!"

The movie simply didn't have time to do this book justice, though it certainly came close.The first half of the book follows Atreyu through Fantastica in his quest to locate someone from outside of the realm and save the princess. This half of the story is beautifully told, the visuals are quite stunning and he characters are true individuals and very well thought out. As you read you want to explore all of the individual untold stories, you want to close your eyes and experience all of the described places for yourself, capture them somehow within you. The writing truly pulls you in as a part of the story.The second part of the book follows Bastian in his journey through Fantastica and though he meets some of the same characters, they seem somehow different and distant. The writing itself, along with the character types and visuals have also changed somehwat, though they are still striking, they seem not quite equal to what was before. Perhaps this is because this is truly a separate plot and so the change in writing style is an emphasis on the fact that this is a separate story, something made individually by Bastian as he continues on his journey. Whatever the reason, this part seems slower than the other and a little more of a learning lesson than an exploration of new places and ideas.By the end of the book a writer will have many inspirations and a reader will want desperately to explore even more of this universe. People who love libraries should have this book within their collection. It is simply a must."

When Bastian steals the book The Neverending Story from Coreander's Book store, he feels he is drawn to the book by some force-one which he is subtly aware of. This force is apparently a guiding beacon, for the book is a portal to Fantastica. The book describes parts of Bastians life though, which really amazes Bastian. Fantastica is a realm that actually has a reality all it's own, and some of the inhabitants, including it's ruler The Empress-know about earthlings. Pretty mind boggling to begin to describe.

This well written book takes you to a world of fantasy where you can become lost in the book and not want to put it down. In the story anything can happen and most of the time it does. Bastian, the main character, is taken to Fantastica to give the Childlike Empress a new name. But, to give her this new name he must go on a journey,far away from Earth. He learns about friendship and how to trust people you don't really know. Although he gets conceited towards the end he learns that he doesn't want power, but all he wants to be is loved. His wishes are running short and he's losing all memories of his world. To make it home he must find the true meaning of why he wants to go home. He makes it home to find his months of long journey in Fantastica was only a day on earth and his father, which he hasn't been close to since his mother died, was shocked when Bastian returned with many, many stories.

I bought it immediately and read it, and it is now one of my favorite books of all time.It tells the story with a depth and detail that the movie only began to reveal, not so much in the story itself, but the philosophy as well. I love the entire concept of the story, how the book Bastian takes is essentially a bridge into the boundless world of dreams and imaginations, how the characters can hear him and what he does will determine the fate of Fantasia (Fantastica in the book). The concepts addressed in the movie appear tenfold in the book. At some points the book is surprisingly dark and eerie, but brilliant all the same.This is book is like no other fantasy I have read.

This is a 613 page anthology of very short mystery stories, all featuring cats in one way or another. Each of the 100 little stories here, by different authors, take only minutes to read and all feature cats either as the good guys, or in some cases the bad.Some of these stories are deadly serious while others are absolutely hilarious. I am not a big reader of mysteries but I found each of these stories, with only a few exceptions, an absolute delight. Of course I admit to being a lover of cats, finding them to be the most fascinating of all our domestic creatures. Having always been owned by one cat or another and having an uncounted number of barn cats, I find ""cat watching"" ranks right up there with bird watching as a pleasing pastime. Being a ""dog person,"" this is quite a confession for me to make.This collection has several things going for it. First, the stories, as mentioned, are quite short and it takes little time to treat yourself to a combination of cat and mystery fix. Secondly, the editors have been quite meticulous in their choice of works to feature. You're going to be treated to some very, very good writing here, some by well known authors, others by not so well known. Talent is talent, and you are served up a good dose of it here. Third, if you run across a story that does not appeal to you, then you can either finish it anyway with no great loss of time or effort, or you can simply stop and move on to the next offering...good grief, you have 100 of them before you!I feel this book would appear to any reader of mysteries and know that it will appeal to any cat lover or anyone interest in both. If you fall into these categories (get it?...CATegories...sorry, little joke, could not help myself), then give yourself a treat or find a copy and give it to them as a special present.

1558605436,Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving,,A2HR1JUGNUQNP,Peter Nordin,32/33,5.0,944092800,Can computers be creative?,"The quest for *Automatic Programming* is the holy grail of artificial intelligence. The dream of having computer programs write other useful computer programs has haunted researchers since the nineteen fifties. In Genetic Programming III -Darwinian Invention and problem solving (GP3) by John R. Koza, Forest H Bennet III, David Andre and Martin A Keane, the authors claim that the first inscription on this trophy should be the name Genetic Programming (GP). GP is about applying evolutionary algorithms to search the space of computer programs. The authors paraphrase Arthur Samuel of 1959 and argue that with this method it is possible to &quot;tell the computer what to do without telling it explicitly how to do it&quot;.The main hypothesis of the book is that GP is not only the first instance of true automatic programming but also creative to such an extant that it competes with humans in solving very hard problems and therefore the solutions produced by GP can sometimes be called inventions, thus the name ""Darwinian Invention Machine"". The book starts by listing sixteen proposed attributes of any automatic programming system. The attribute list begins with obvious properties such as the ability to produce entities that can run on a computer, continues by describing components of full computer programs and ends by expressing fuzzier concepts such as applicability, scalability and competitiveness with human-produced results. The authors argue that GP definitely has most of the 16 attributes and at least to some extent possesses the remaining few. The last attribute, human competitive results, is in turn defined by a list of eight properties where each of them gives enough evidence to conclude competitiveness to results produced by the intellect of a human. This list includes concepts such as whether the results are pantentable, publishable in scientific journals or better then best known human solutions. GP3 reports 14 experiments by the authors where the they claim that GP produced results fulfilling one or more of these properties and thus are competitive with that of a skilled human such as an engineer, mathematician, designer or programmer. Examples of results with the &quot;darwinian invention quality&quot; include sorting networks, analogue electrical circuit synthesis and creation of motifs for protein family detection. Pointers are also given to human competitive solutions evolved by other researchers.Overall there is no question that this is an important book putting the spotlight on one of the peak performing and most promising candidates for the general AI prize. There is no doubt that this book belongs in the standard library of all GP researchers or practitioners. This volumous book is a bit heterogeneous, probably stemming from the fact that is combined from a number of previously published papers with some new material. On the other hand is the volume important documentation of innovative work done by John Koza and his colleagues. In many place numerous pointers to work by other researchers are given but in the end I believe that the book would have a stronger case for presenting the GP state-of-the-art by including more references to similar research by other research groups.However most important and intriguing thing about this book is the provocative questions raised concerning definitions and claims of human competitive performance, &quot;Darwinian invention&quot; and artificial intelligence - particularly whether we have already passed an important milestone in the history of AI - automatic programming."
1558605436,Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving,,A3EQQP0LD4Z375,Dr. Lee D. Carlson,24/26,5.0,996192000,A hint of the future.....,"The authors have written a fine book here and it has and will continue to be a source of good information on the subject. What is most interesting about the approach of genetic programming is that it does not make use of the inference methods of formal logic in the search for the correct program. Correctly observing that logical thinking is insufficient for invention and creativity, the authors follow the &quot;logic considered harmful&quot; philosophy in their attempts to get a computer to find a creative/original solution to a problem. And most importantly, they discuss fourteen examples where genetic programming has produced results that are competitive with human-produced results. The book is almost 1200 pages long, but without reading all the examples one could cover the main points in a reasonable time frame. The reader knowing the LISP language will appreciate the discussion more.After a brief introduction to the book in chapter 1, the authors move on to a detailed discussion of the philosophy and approaches used in genetic programming. They list the five steps that must be done before applying a genetic algorithm to a problem and give an overview of the LISP background needed to understand genetic programming. The authors emphasize that the genetic algorithm is probabilistic in nature, with the initial populations, individual selection, and genetic operation chosen at random. They give flowcharts illustrating a typical genetic algorithm and program, and then show executable programs can be automatically created. A very extensive list of references on genetic programming is given at the end of the chapter.In the next part, the authors discuss how to eliminate the requirement that the programmer specify the architecture in advance to the program to be created. After reviewing some methods that were previously used to make the choice of architecture, the authors move on to describing a set of architecture-altering operations that give an automated method for determining the architectures of evolving programs. The discussion on automatically defined recursion is particularly interesting.The book then shows how to use the results so far to allow problem-solving to be done using genetic programming, the first one being the rotation of automobile tires and the second being evolving a computer program with the behavior of Boolean even-parity functions. This is followed by a discussion of how to use architecture-altering operations to solve a time-optimal control problem. The most interesting part of this discussion is that it illustrates the important point that disadvantageous actions should be taken in the short term so that the long-term objective can be achieved.In chapter 14, the ant foraging problem is used to illustrate a form of the (Minsky) multiagent problem and architecture-altering operations. This is followed by discussions on the digit recognition problem and the transmembrane segment identification problem. The authors choose the Fibonacci sequence to illustrate how recursion can be used in solving problems with genetic programming. The necessity of using internal storage is illustrated using the cart centering problem.The authors then overview the use of the Genetic Programming Problem Solver (GPPS) for automatically creating a computer program to solve a problem. Several problems are examined using this Solver, such as symbolic regression, sorting networks, and the intertwined spirals problem.The next part then considers the application of genetic programming to the automated synthesis of analog electrical circuits. The authors judge, rightfully, that the design process is one that will be a good judge of automated technique versus one that was done by humans, especially considering the fact that analog design is considered by many to be an &quot;art&quot; rather than a &quot;science&quot;. The authors show how to import the SPICE simulation system into the genetic programming system, and discuss how validation of circuit design using this simulator would be done by the genetic programming system. After showing how a low-pass filter may be successfully designed using the genetic programming system, the authors show how with a few changes it can be used to design many different types of circuits. Interestingly, the authors cite the rediscovery by genetic programming of the elliptic filter topology of W. Cauer. Cauer arrived at his discovery via the use of elliptic functions, but the genetic program did not make use of these, but relied solely on the problem's fitness measure and natural selection!An interesting discussion is also given of the role of crossover in genetic programming by comparing the problem of synthesizing a lowpass filter with and without using crossover. The authors conclude that the crossover operation plays a large contribution to the actual solution of the problem.Then later, the authors show how genetic programming actually evolved a cellular automata that performs better than a succession of algorithms written by humans in the last two decades. Specifically, they show how genetic programming evolved a rule for the majority classification problem for one-dimensional two-state cellular automata that exceeds the accuracy of all known rules.Most interestingly, the authors show how genetic programming evolved motifs for detecting the D-E-A-D box family of proteins and for detecting the manganese superoxide dismutase family.The actual performance and implementation issues involved in genetic programming are discussed in the last two parts of the book. They discuss the computer time needed to yield the 14 instances where they claim that genetic programming has produced results that are competitive with human-produced results.The authors wrap things up in the last chapter of the book and discuss other instances where genetic programming has succeeded in automatically producing computer programs that are competitive with human-produced results. The evidence they have in the book is impressive but there are a few areas that will be ultimate tests of this approach, the most important being the discovery of new mathematical results or algorithms. It is this area that requires the most creativity on the part of the inventor."

This book addresses how to evolve program architecture, that's why! Living organisms didn't grow arms and eyes through simple mutation. It required more subtle genetic operators. Traditional genetic operators (as used in genetic algorithms) may be sufficient for evolving solutions to optimization problems where the structure if not the specifics of each solution is pretty much the same.

1558605436,Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving,,,,15/80,1.0,936403200,Buzz word soup from high priced nerds,"Recently I received a video survey of this book, I feel compelled to give a review. If I was sent me the book I might review it, but the is so darn long.The tape starts off with sixteen criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of a genetic programming program. Pretty good criteria.It then suggest that programs will be mutated and checked for their value at solving the problem. This also seems reasonable. It is called search. If one can do the search in parallel, then this seems reasonable as we know parallel search is reasonable. Since we know that a program can be thought of as a set of 0's and 1's we could simply mutate the string and bingo new programs. Of course this kind of dumb search would take a lot longer than the universe has been around (a lot lot longer in most cases) but if one has time to read a thousand page book then maybe you have more time than I.So their solution is to understand the structure of the program and then to make smarter mutations. And here is the rub. You have to understand the structure of the program which is a lot of work.The authors try to suggest how to do this automatically or generally but of course this really can't be done.( Ask Turing if he were alive) Their method is to essentially paramaterize the program at many levels and then permute these chunks. Nice but it takes the intelligence to find the chunks. However if you find the right chunks , I have no doubt that a computer can finish the problem. Computers are good at finding solutions once the search space has been properly limited.Bottom line, search takes either a near infinite amount of time or encoded knowledge. A finite program can only encode a finite amount of knowledge so general (finite) search programs can never do well. However if you just have a human keep giving them more knowledge they will do well and that is called programming.Hope that boring guy in the video gets a life, but he won't do it with my 78 dollars.Later, Big Fan of Mr. Turing"

Still she once in a while dreams of being a top rate journalistic photographer who her subjects love not hates and has fans that enjoy her art not her subject. In other words one day she would like to be a news photographer in a less intrusive line.When she tries to take pictures of superstar Ethan Wyatt, he becomes outraged and vows to teach the pest a lesson. Ethan begins to stalk Sadie so that she can become the subject of her odious peers who take photos of her in any situation. She detests the feeling of her every move being watched which curtails her freedom. However worse is that she is attracted to Ethan although he brought the Paparazzi Plague onto her. He, in turn, reciprocates, but like her, hides how he feels as a star and a paparazzi make the ultimate star-crossed lovers.The ACCIDENTAL IT GIRL reads like a 1930s romantic romp brought into 2006 Manhattan to the delight of contemporary readers. The amusing gender war is fun to follow as Ethan turns the tables on Sadie by making her the subject of the hunt.

Libby Street has created believable, hilarious characters you can't help routing for- and laughing with. Taking the very original concept of turning the tables on a paparazzi photographer, the book asks the question, what happens when the roles are reversed and the hunter becomes the hunted? Sadie Price is at the top of her game professionally, but more than a little embarrassed by what she does for a living, when she manages to annoy the wrong actor on the wrong day. Ethan Wyatt has finally had enough of living life in a fishbowl and decides to give Sadie a taste of her own medicine. He begins documenting her every move with a camera. He's got some serious clout as a movie star, and manages to plant false stories in the tabloids about her. This effectively turns her life into chaos as she's suddenly the top story of the day. I thought the way each chapter ended, with a ""tabloid"" snippet of Sadie's life and the Hollywood elite, was a very funny touch. Great writing keeps this story moving forward and Sadie Price is a wonderful example of a modern woman. Funny, smart, and vulnerable, she needs a man who is her equal and Ethan Wyatt doesn't disappoint in that department.

Some of his writing is charming in its simplicity, but some of it is pretty clunky.For example, here is part of the dialog he documents between him and his mother, after he abruptly got married without her knowledge. Armstrong, defending his decision, says to his mother, ""You must realize that I didn't go any further than fifth grade in school myself. But with my good sense and mother-wit (sic), and knowing how to treat and respect the feelings of other people, that's all I've needed in life. You taught me that, mother."" A fine philosophy of life, put in humble and concise manner. But then he goes on to write, ""Then she said, 'You must bring your wife to me; I want to meet her.' With a palpating heart I gave a big sigh of relief and said: 'Oh, thanks, mom.'""

Good as the doctors and nurses were, I soon discovered that they were most willing to treat my symptoms, that is the outer reality, but there was no inclination whatsoever to address the inner reality,that is the spiritual and emotional aspects of the patient. In most oncology centers, as far as I can see, the holistic approach is practically unknown, to all intents and purposes.Dr. Geffen explains the basics of the disease and the treatments in very clear terms, so that we are aware of the various processes. These explanations were very helpful to me when asking questions of the doctors and nurses.I learned from Dr.Geffen that true healing can only come from within ourselves, once we have been able to overcome our fears and denials, once we have reversed our tendencies to repress and withhold, and to view, or feel, that treatments are ordeals to be borne, instead of envisaging our whole being as coming into action in tandem with the treatments. In ""The Hound of Heaven"", the poet Francis Thomson says: ""Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue"" - in order to heal, our goal should be to replace fear with love, and Dr.Geffen illustrates this in a singularly illuminating way.One of Dr.Geffen's most compelling concepts is that of transformation: we are not at war, we are not trying to kill or destroy anything, our wish is to bring harmony throughout our bodies. There is intelligence in all our cells, and our wish is to make all of them aware of their inherent power for wellbeing and joy.A Journey through Cancer is a masterpiece of a rare order: it is imbued with knowledge, kindness, understanding, and above all it shows that the path of healing, and eventually of being, is through consciousness."

Williams's sophomore novel, Vindictive Wo-Men, she writes several short stories peppered with violent and sadistic sexual encounters. I guess the purpose of short stories is to give a reader a glimpse at what is in the author's imagination with the hopes that the premise is good enough to become a full fledged novel. According to what is written on the back cover, Williams is planning to develop at least one of the stories into a screenplay. Interesting.The stories in this novel range from a delusional teenage girl trying desperately to hold onto a man who has ""hit it and quit it""; a crazed mother with 10 children and 10 baby daddies, who cannot control her rage when baby number 10 daddy focuses too much attention on the baby; to a psychologist who has an affair with a drug dealing client when she is supposed to be counseling him and his fiance. There are several more stories, all which contain violence and brutal sexual behavior.As I was reading this book, the thought ""why"" came to mind. Why publish these stories?

Williams is a collection of short stories with situations ranging from the actions of a young woman scorned, to a son determined to make a father pay for his painful childhood. Throughout the book Williams has written tales that include deceit, jealousy, secrets and more.""Foolish Love"" is about a young girl who wants to get revenge on a man she loves, but who does not love her. A woman who seeks revenge on her baby's father is portrayed in the shocking ""Be Careful What You Ask 4."" In ""An Open Door"" Williams creates a character determined to get revenge at any cost. Also included is "".evoL nI looF A"" (A Fool in Love) which would be even better as a full length novel. Each of these stories is about getting even, but there are also some that include lessons too. ""Taking Over"" shows what happens when you allow drugs and the wrong people into your life and ""Brave Heart"" shows that age does not determine courage.While Williams has done a good job compiling her stories, there are some that fall short. An example is ""Church Vixen,"" a story about the affairs of a churchgoer. Taking up only two pages it lacks the vindictive element found in the other stories. ""Things About Her Life She Wouldn't Tell a Priest"" is about a woman and her sexual experiences beginning as a child that may leave the reader confused.Overall Williams' book of short stories is enjoyable. She has created characters you'll love to hate and even some you'll feel sorry for. The descriptions of each situation allow the reader to get caught up in each individual story. Her writing also includes shocking moments that will make your jaw drop. Readers will not be disappointed; instead they'll be left thinking about the lengths someone may go to get revenge on them.Reviewed by Criss Colesof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"

Perhaps it's the Swedish character & setting of this haunting young adult novel that lifts it far above cheap & easy sentiment. Certainly the writing is superb: spare, honest, bracing as a cold lake beneath an endless twilight sky, with the stark beauty of a pristine black & white film.It's written in the form of a long letter to a friend, as Annika flees to her family's summer cottage to be alone & grapple with her fate. Her life barely begun, she's forced to come to terms with it, with all that she'll never experience, with all that she's lost before she could even begin to grasp it. The immensity of that challenge is presented quietly but powerfully, without melodrama.Slowly she works her way through darkness, finding a dignity & strength that many never achieve in a lengthy lifetime. The enduring image is that of a frail but resolute figure standing firmly against an unfair, uncaring universe, preparing to step forward to meet it. Deeply moving & memorable, it deserves to be brought back into print. Highly recommended!"

It's the basic intention of this book to make the reader understand landscape as a phenomenon situated between the two (seemingly) opposite poles of nature and culture and, to make us experience the necessity for a sustainable ecological preservation and development of nature through the intervention of art. This is evidenced by a multitude of examples with great illustrations, easy to grasp in the first chapters of the book and becoming increasingly complex and diverse thereafter, particularly in the last part which deals with integrative landscape art. As important and meaningful as the illustrations are the essays compiled in this book. In many respects they provide the fundament for understanding the various images and provide access to the ideas of ecological aesthetics. Although the book may primarily be directed towards artists, art and cultural scientists it is eventually a stimulus for reflexion and an aesthetic joy also for people who, like me, are not active in the art business."

Charles Erlandson,0/0,4.0,1312675200,"First Treatment of the Oxford Movement: Good, but Limited","The Oxford Movement was such a potent force in the Church of England in the nineteenth century that an adequate understanding of it is essential to students of Anglicanism and of the history of the Church of England. The first book written to promulgate an understanding of the Oxford Movement is R. W. Church's 1891 ""The Oxford Movement: Twelve Years, 1833-1845. As the first book on the topic, Church's book has had a large influence on the literature of the Oxford Movement over the years. It continues to be a good introduction to the subject but is lacking in a few ways as well.Church was himself in an ideal situation from which to write such a book, being first a student and then a tutor at Oriel College, Oxford at the same time as John Henry Newman and John Keble. In fact, Church became a disciple and close friend of Newman, which helps explain in part why Church's view of the Oxford Movement is written largely through the lens of Newman and his dynamic, turbulent thought. This is at least one reason why Church considers the Oxford Movement as a twelve year period (from Keble's Assize Sermon in 1833 until Newman's joining the Roman Catholic Church in 1845). Until recently, most scholars of the Oxford Movement have joined Church in reading the Oxford Movement primarily through the lens of Newman. However, Church's work would have been more powerful and useful if it had dealt with the aftermath of Newman's departure and its effect on the Oxford Movement.Church writes with a terse, narrative style and focuses primarily on the principal players of the Oxford Movement. His first-hand knowledge of the people involved is one strength of the book, and his narrative style makes the book easy to read. However, the focus on people means that to some degree a more objective analysis of the meaning and import of the Oxford Movement was left to other writers. Church is clear in his Advertisement that he did not pretend to write a history of the movement or adequately to judge it but intended to preserve a contemporary memorial of a ""true and noble effort which passed before my eyes, with all that was in it of self-devotion, affectionateness, and high and refined and varied character . . . .""In summary, Church's work is a good one but limited in a number of ways. Modern students of the Oxford Movement should especially read Nockles ""The Oxford Movement in Context."""
B000P29XSI,Software Measurement and Estimation: A Practical Approach (Quantitative Software Engineering Series),16.99,AJY6SC7QF7O9I,MAURICIO AGUIAR,6/7,4.0,1166745600,Very Good Book,"It is amazing how much information could be packed into a book of only 250 pages (approximately). This is probably the best book one can currently buy for a good introduction to software measurement and estimation. It is both a guide for students as well as a reference for software measurement practitioners. The book contains small imperfections that can be fixed and by no means reduce its value. They will certainly be corrected in a future edition. Comments below:- Chapter 1 / Section 1.4 about the CMMI mentions the Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas (PAs) but fails to mention the Measurement and Analysis process area - that has everything to do with the book's theme.- Chapter 2 provides a short (and good) description of the GQM (Goal/Question/Metric) approach but fails to mention the PSM (Practical Software & Systems Measurement) methodology, even though the PSM book is listed as reference [3] at the end of the chapter. Also, Section 2.3 is titled ""Method 3: Standards Driven Metrics"" but does not mention the ISO/IEC 15939 standard (Software Engineering - Software Measurement Process), which is related to the CMMI Measurement and Analysis PA and also to the Practical Software & Systems Measurement initiative. Any book on Software Measurement should cover the ISO/IEC 15939 standard.- Chapter 3 contains a very good explanation of measurement scales, measures of central tendency, measures of variability, measurement errors, accuracy, and precision.- Chapter 4 is about software sizing. Even though the coverage is very good, the chapter fails to inform the reader that 3 of the FSM methods - IFPUG, NESMA (Netherlands Software Metrics Users Association, not even mentioned), and COSMIC have become ISO standards. It should also be said that IFPUG considers the Value Adjustment Factor optional since 2003. The main IFPUG Function Point reference, the Counting Practices Manual, is not listed as a reference at the end of the chapter.- Chapter 5 features a good introduction to complexity measures, including McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, Halstead's measure, and the Agresti-Card-Glass system complexity metric. Object-oriented design metrics are also covered in this chapter. The author explains those measures very clearly including examples.- Chapter 6 is about effort estimation. Again the author provides excellent and comprehensive explanations of several estimation models, such as expert opinion (including Delphi), benchmark data, analogy, proxy points, custom models, and algorithmic models. On page 96 the author directs the reader to reference [10] for the IFPUG website. As it turns out, reference [10] on page 116 points to the website of a consulting company. It would be nice to have this fixed in the next edition of the book. On page 104 COCOMO II is mentioned but the example on page 105 uses COCOMO 81. The reader should be aware that COCOMO 81 has been replaced by COCOMO II. On page 106 some estimation tools are listed, namely COCOMO, SPR, and Checkpoint. COCOMO itself is not a tool so it would have been better to use the USC COCOMO II free tool as an example, as well as commercial tools such as COSTAR and Cost Xpert. SPR is listed as a tool when it is actually a company that used to sell the Checkpoint tool that has been replaced by KnowledgePlan.- Chapter 7 provides the reader with a very good introductory treatment of defects. Figure 7.6 on page 122 depicts a size-defect relationship that has been ""linearized"" through the use of a log-log scale. That should be clearly explained (the text refers to the relationship as linear). Overall this is an excellent chapter.- Chapter 8, 9, and 10 are, respectively, about reliability, response time and availability, and measuring progress. They are all very good and I can only recommend them. Excellent explanations and references.- Chapters 11 and 12 - Outsourcing and Financial Measures - seem a little displaced in this book, even though they can still be useful for students.- Chapter 13 on Benchmarking is perhaps too short to give the theme a fair treatment.- Chapter 14 on Presenting Metrics to Management is very interesting and potentially useful to measurement analysts. The author teaches the reader how to create a dashboard for all metrics to be viewed as a whole.What I like about this book is that it deals with the most important topics of software measurement and estimation without being bulky or tedious. The language is simple and keeps the reader interested throughout the 250 pages. Recommended.I hope this review helps potential readers as well as the author of this very good book."

Russ and his sister, Joy, decide to use the money that their grandmother gave them in order to buy 100 shares of Latitude and Longitude, a brokerage house that they encounter after pressing a magical elevator button that leads them to the company's location, the North Pole. Their hopes are soon dashed when they discover that shortly after their investment deal is made, their shares originally priced at $1.00 are now worth only 2 cents a share - a significant loss of $108.00.Russ and Joy's initial despair turns into hope as they master a plan to not only get back the money that their grandmother gave them, but to also benefit other college-bound youngsters. Their plan entails marketing Latitude and Longitude's latest book with one twist - those who find the picture of the four-leaf clover in the back of the book would be entitled to 100 shares of Latitude and Longitude. Moreover, the profits would be earmarked to go into a college scholarship fund. Therefore, Russ and Joy set out on their dream endeavor. Their father, initially dubious about the execution of their plan, finally agrees to contact his good friend, Mr. Flound-Ar, the president of the publishing company of Latitude and Longitude. (Their mother also has an active role since she is on the Board of Latitude and Longitude.) After negotiating the advertisement at school and on the web, the responses for the book begin to pour in. As planned, a young person from every continent wins 100 shares of the company, thus providing a source of money for the college scholarships.As in the real-life situation, Russ and Joy discover that the profit from their plan is not instantaneous, but slow and gradual. However, they learn the true lesson that &quot;the stock market is not an exact science&quot; (p.58)This book is a useful and fun guide for readers of all ages who wish to learn about the stock market.

I know very well that peak performance depends very much on the brain working in perfect harmony & close integration with the body. I therefore also own quite a lot of books about enhancing body performance.This is one of them, which is also one of the few I always keep on my immediate shelf for quick reference.Although it has been written essentially as an introduction to Hellerwork, I find the authors' intellectual work in creating the connection between life issues & natural bodily alignment very illuminating. Additionally, he shows how to restore the body's natural balance from the inside out.Obviously both authors have profound understanding of the human body & its possibilities for maximum health & efficiency.I did not realise that one of the authors (Joseph Heller) was an aerospace engineer by training until I read this book.

Let me recap their exact words in the last chapter: ""...Enlightenment is not something that ony happen when you meditate, chant your mantra, listen to your favourite piece of music: It is something that happens every day, in the way you move, relate to others, work, cook supper, brush your teeth. The challenge or purpose of life is to experience it as fully as possible at every moment. Your body is both vehicle & metaphor for your process: When the hologram is integrated with the being, the result is enlightenment."" [The authors use the hologram, in an abstract sense, to represent the exact physical expression of a person's mind & spirit; in a concrete sense, any part of the body may be seen to reflect & contain everything there is to know about the whole body, just like a hologram.]On the whole, the many ideas in this book are definitely worth exploring from the standpoint of becoming a full-time owner of your own body!"

'Man and Wife' was written right after 'The Moonstone', the last of his really successful novels. Sadly, this novel is unjustly overlooked by Wilkie Collins fans. It's actually a fun read.'Man and Wife' is a complicated story about a young couple, and their friends/family, caught up in the consequences of lax marriage laws during the Victorian era. At that time folks in Scotland were considered married if they simply announced it. No need for marriage licenses, blood tests, etc. Wilkie Collins's gift of building the suspense works well, and the book's ending is unexpected (and terrific).'Man and Wife' is every bit as good as, say, 'The Moonstone'. However for Wilkie Collins neophytes I suggest first trying 'The Woman in White' or 'No Name' (..both are my favorites).PS - I think the previous reviewer is mistaken. This book has nothing to do with intrusive mother-in-laws."
0809594781,Man and Wife,32.95,A1DBGXI1U93MM1,Elizabeth,6/6,5.0,1271289600,A harsh view of Victorian marriages,"Man and Wife is a novel of two generations of marriages that end in disaster. However, the novel is much more than the story of a helpless Victorian bride at the mercy of her despotic husband. Instead, Man and Wife explores the complex laws surrounding Irish and Scottish marriages in the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins's interest in the law, especially marriage and divorce, lead to a novel with endless legal loopholes concerning what constitututes a marriage and what doesn't.The lives of two generation of friends named Anne and Blanche are forever changed by the laws concerning man and wife. The first generation Anne and Blanche are childhood friends. Anne Vanborough's Irish marriage is declared null and void by English law. She dies broken hearted and entreats her dearest friend, Anne, to look after he daughter also named Anne. As Anne lay dying she thinks of her daughter and wonders ""will she end like me?"".After Anne's death, Blanche raises little Anne as her own. Little Anne and Blanche's daughter also named Blanche become best friends. However, history is determined to repeat itself in a much more tragic manner.Another marriage comes under scrutiny. Another woman is forced to become an outcast by the legal system. Anne and Blanche are destined to relive the events that cursed their mothers. I absolutely recommend this novel to all WC fans. Many parts of the novel will move you to tears, others will leave you livid. In my opinion, Man and Wife features the most despicable character I've ever encountered in a Collins novel. An excellent read!"

With exciting prose and plotting, Collins produces in the second quarter of the book a pursuit sequence almost as riveting as *Dracula's* 1897 mountain chase. The misdeed is largely psychological and societal: a woman promised but not given marriage becomes pregnant, and she has to be very resourceful in identifying a way to keep her baby legitimate as she hides her condition under the bustles of Victorian dress codes. So far, shades of Hardy's *Two On A Tower,* except this is not a romance. Rather, it is an excoriation of Victorian male-female privilege disparities using bizarre, and actual, Scottish marriage laws of the time.It was written after Collins' blockbuster 1860s novels. As a result, it has the more finely nuanced understanding of human nature that he honed until his very finest novel (*The Evil Genius* comedy). However, it was composed in 1870, and the proximity to his very purple sensation novels like *Armadale* and *Woman In White* leave *Man & Wife* turning in the last quarter to a jep novel that is a sensation style but not as campily over-the-top as the 60s volumes. Fortunately, there is finely-observed satire and comedy to lighten the mood most of the way. It is stronger than that other hidden gem of Collins, *Hide & Seek* and more believable than *The Moonstone.* So cinematic, I'm surprised it hasn't been made into a Gosford Park-style treat."

He also covers coding with the Turning grille and PlayFair. The book covers all new information different from the first but as a nice continuation of the field of spies and code breaking.He also includes, as with his other books in this series, a computer disk that allows for interaction with all the codes covered. In the back is several examples and tests of the codes and how they work and how they are solved with the aid of the computer rather than requiring the use of paper and pencil which could add frustration to those new in the art of code breaking.A wonderful book to continue the learning of history changing events involving spying and the tracking and intercepting of codes from Robert Reynard.This book is highly recommended for children and adults since it is easy to follow and hard to put down once you start understanding the codes. I recommend all three books in this series since there is no repeat of information in any of the three and they can be read in any order but the author intentionally has started with the more simpler codes and code breaking in the first and then a little more challenging in this second book.

The author manages to keep the tone light and conversational, yet touch all of the important aspects of successfully managing software projects. While I am one of those die hards who doesn't believe in silver bullets--those elusive shortcuts to accomplishing complex tasks--any more than I believe in the tooth fairy, I think that the approach in this book comes close.Although the tone is light, the techniques are solid. I like the way the author strips away non-essential tasks and focuses on what is essential to successfully managing a project. He starts with visualizing the goal, which is an exercising in defining project objectives, and introduces a key concept that will be used through the book: Probability of Success Indicator (PSI). These indicators are checkpoints for ensuring that all critical success factors are satisfied and are closely tied to risk management. I especially like the common sense way projects are approached - develop a checklist, emphasize leadership and teamwork, carefully plan and manage expectations and communicate. These are the essence of project management, regardless of whether you are using the U.S. standard set forth in the PMBOK or the UK PRINCE2 approach. In fact, all of the techniques, including the 10-step methodology given in the book, will work with both the PMBOK and PRINCE2 approaches.Chapters I especially liked covered assessing project plans, issue resolution and how to shorten projects using accelerated analysis and design. I found some of the appendices valuable as well, especially Appendix 1 (ISO 9000 Estimating Procedure) and Appendix 2 (Structured Project Management, which summarizes the 10-step approach. If you use MS Project (which I do not), Appendix 6, Learning Microsoft Project 2000, may be useful.The only shortcoming is the lack of earned value as a project control tool, but for small projects this isn't a major issue. Overall this is an excellent book for new project managers for software development projects and it is also full of tips and techniques that an experienced project manager will appreciate."

Circumstances have been difficult in his life, and temptations and depression always flirt with him as he navigates through a career and singlehood. Amidst a small circle of friends he gets to know someone he thinks is his distaff equivalent, a woman who has faced struggles but keeps her head above water with pride.

I have a master's degree yet I had to keep a dictionary handy to look up all the five-syllable, three-dollar words he used--how can his subjects, who have little education beyond their terrible public high school, keep their eyes open reading this stuff? Also, beats you over the head with allegory--the scenes of desolate streets may be symbolic, but the journalists' credo is to SHOW us how it's symbolic, not merely TELL us. (Tip to writers: Don't say &quot;one gets the sense that...&quot; Paint the picture well enough, and we WILL get the sense; paint the picture poorly and we won't.) Frey could've taken some style points from Rick Telander's &quot;Heaven is a Playground,&quot; whose language better fits the subject without losing any of the drama, the outrage, the sense of injustice and inequity. Telander's book was certainly just as profound--and much more fun to read.Frey's magazine article on which this is based still uses a lot of three-dollar words but is much more concise and to the point, and therefore a much better read. Read that version instead (I think it's in &quot;Best American Sportswriting 1994)."

0684815095,"The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams",,A13KBFDH0WJIBR,Eric Angevine,1/1,5.0,1244073600,Compelling Read,"This is one of the best sports books I've ever read. Darcy Frey embedded himself in the desolate housing projects of Coney Island for two years, to the point where he became the de facto transportation option for the poor kids he was shadowing. He emerged with a document that goes beyond the thrill of sports (though that's here) and delves into society, education, and individual motivation.This book has been around a while - it was published in 1994 - but it still rings true, despite the references to razor haircuts and DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince lyrics. Frey follows one special group of basketball players at Coney Island's Abraham Lincoln High. Power forward Tchaka Shipp, guards Corey Johnson and Russell Thomas, and a playground tag-along (who joins the team as a freshman in the second half of the book) by the name of Stephon Marbury. The double-entendre in the book's title becomes poignant from page one: nobody in the projects wants their last shot on the high school basketball court to be their last shot at a decent life.The overwhelming basketball talent possessed by this quartet of kids is immediately evident. Any one of them is talented enough to play some level of DI ball. That ability level has been evident at Lincoln High for years, but most players become Prop 48 casualties. So Frey begins to look at the educational system and social culture of the projects that so often help to snatch away the one ray of promise that's dangled in front of young men.When you read about how difficult it is for inner-city kids to get a meager 700 on their SAT's after years of sub-par schooling, you may not be so quick to judge the academic malfeasance that currently dogs the Memphis program. None of us has ever been faced with the choice to cheat on college eligibility or turn to the drug trade. This book does an excellent job of exploring the shades of grey that lie between coaches, players, businessmen, and the NCAA.To his credit, after a bitter conversation with Marbury's grasping father, Frey even looks at his own complicity in the game. Would he be there, talking to these kids, if their basketball skills couldn't sell books? So, he tries to do the right thing, and strike a deal to share book revenue with his subjects. But who should come calling to put the kibosh on that? Good ol' uncle NCAA, of course. By paying them to talk, he could further reduce their already miniscule chances of playing DI ball.For me, the greatest thing about this book was that it put a face on the kids whose names get bandied about on team message boards. To recruiters and fans, they're just pieces of meat until they sign on the dotted line. But in this book, we see four kids from the same place with widely divergent personalities.Big man Shipp struggles with his game despite having made his SAT score early on. When he puts them both together just in time for ABCD camp, his future comes into sharp focus. Thomas (not his real name) works obsessively on his game, and it shows. All he wants is an education to build on, but he can't seem to get over that SAT hump. Johnson loves to write and fool around, and not pay attention to the work he needs to put in. Marbury? He's been recruited since he was 13, but he's seen each of his older brothers try and fail to make a living playing ball. He, obviously, becomes the book's big success story. An appended afterword tells what became of all four since the book was written.This book is hard to put down once you've started. My copy got doused with water at my son's soccer game, but I kept turning those damp, warped pages just the same, eager to find out what would happen. I could have looked it all up online, but the story was told in such a compelling fashion that I had no desire to cheat.Marco and I have sacrificed a lot of our potential summer audience because we both hate recruiting talk with a passion. This book will give you a clear inside look at why that unsavory underworld is so important to all parties involved, and also why it is broken to the point of being heartbreaking.This book is a classic. If you need a beach read this summer, I highly recommend it."

It's a well written story about some kids in the 90's who live in the projects in Brooklyn, Coney Island for the most part, and how much basketball means to them. In the book it seems like basketball is their only path to success. But they are up against the recruiters, hustlers and the SATS (which they need to get a 700 on but that's just out of reach for most).You get to meet the student athletes, Russell, Corey, Tchak, and Stephon, their parents, coaches, recruiters, local prophets, etc, and the author treats them all with a level of respect the New York Times Magazine accords the suit wearing sharks.If you get this book, you won't have to read long before you're committed to reading the whole thing.

If you are an all star, or don't play basketball at all, you'll really like this book. This book is so incredible because, although it describes basketball playing thoroughly, it also describes a city life few people know of. Darcey pulls you into an interesting ride as Tchaka goes through the college recruiting process, Russell struggles with his SATS and jump shot (off the dribble), Corey aimlessly wastes his obvious intelligence, natural basketball skill and talent in rapping, and as Stephon wows everyone with his superiour skill in basketball. Where Tchaka is serious about basketball, Russell is serious about college and education, Corey is hardly serious about anything and Stephon is still finding out what he's serious about. Tchaka has charm, he's tall, thin, plays power forward, and does well enough on his SATS to get into college. Russell is dedicated, he studies nightly, practices daily, and even shoots from a lawn chair in the local park. Corey is without purpose, he's an awesome basketball player, he could easily get good grades, should he apply himself, and he rights poetry fantasticly. Stephon has an attitude, he's seen his talented brothers not go to college, and waste their talent, so he practices and studies, but he knows he's great. This is a fantastic book, and an educational read on many levels."

(from a saber cut fighting the dern British at General Washington's side.) and he's not the handsome loutish lad, (who also is overfond of drink and deceitful, too. Can you see where this is going? If you guessed straight into marriage and a Big Misunderstanding, you're spot on. Add in self- divorce and criminal conversation (google it. Go ahead, I'll wait.) and some Federalism era politics you've got the basic story ( though considering all the talk of criminal conversation, which still is the legal term on the subject in North Carolina and some other states, Rachel's passage probably has an unintended double meaning.)Actually, there were some interesting bits here and there, mostly due to Paula Reid (Schwartz)'s good research. She was a friend of my mother's (known as my friend, the romance writer), who also wrote under the names Paula Jonas, Paula Reibel, Paula Reidalos, and regency stuff under the name of Elizabeth Mansfield. I believe she took my mom to a Romance writer's conference once, which pulled my mother to a different sort of book to read. Until that time Georgette Heyers and Jane Austen were her chick lit. For the last 15 or 20 years of her life, whole new worlds were opened up, thanks to that trip."

Dr. Linebarger describes the history of psychological warfare, from the three elephants leashed together by the Mongol emperor Tamerlane to inspire awe in the enemy to certain leaflets, dropped over Japan by the American military in World War II, which attempted to convince civilians to move away from cities targeted by American bombers. Dr. Linebarger goes on to create a typology of the forms organized persuasion can take, and to establish basic principles for its effective use.""Psychological Warfare"" will provide the reader with neither ""cutting-edge"" nor, usually, specifically military techniques, but it will provide a competent theoretical exploration of the purpose and nature of persuasive media.In ""Psychological Warfare,"" the sharpness of Dr. Linebarger's thought as well as his interest in folk culture and his long immersion in East Asia are evident."

B000GXWO0U,Cambridge Companion to Conducting,,,,49/51,5.0,1082160000,Couldn't put it down,"Full disclosure: I wrote one of the chapters (see the TOC below for detail -I can't figure out how to put my name in the &quot;public nickname&quot; slot at Amazon). But I don't get paid royalties as far as I know, and I don't mind if you skip my chapter when you get the book - I did! (Haven't had the courage to read it yet.) I mention all this to be upfront, and not use a pseudonym on Amazon - a common practice by authors, I've heard.I'm writing because I read the book (the parts by everyone else) and feel too enthusiastic to keep quiet about it. I literally couldn't put the book down. When I received my copy, I stayed up way past my bedtime reading it, ignoring sleepiness and the fact that I had to go to work the next morning. If you are at all interested in the topic, I don't know of anything of its type that's richer or more engaging. Don't assume that it's another collection of academic papers; instead it has insights not only from scholars but also from conductors (e.g., Mackerras), orchestral players, record producers, and managers. To give you an idea and help you determine if this book would interest you, here's the table of contents, with my short notes on a few chapters - ande they all deserve comment, but I will leave that to others:Part I. Practice:1. The technique of conducting - Raymond Holden2. Conductors in rehearsal - Charles Barber [conductor, archivist of conducting films, so this has details on historical greats like Furtwaengler]3. Studio conducting - Michael Haas [producer of Solti and Abbado recordings- fascinating information about their recordings and why conducting in the studio, which is what most of us hear in our CD collections, is so different from conducting in concert]4. The conductor and the soloist - Joseph Silverstein [he's outstanding both as a conductor and a soloist, and former concertmaster at Boston so he played with many greats; again, a lot of interesting stuff]5. Choral conducting - Vance George [SF chorus master, great choral conductor, very useful]6. Opera conducting - Sir Charles Mackerras [need I say more?]7. The orchestra speaks - Robert L. Ripley [played in Cleveland and Boston SOs for many years. Great chapter! A lot of detail about famous conductors and what they did well or badly in working with orchestras.]Part II. History: [as good a history as I've seen. It really clarifies the context out of which such apparently unique figures as, say, Toscanini arose.]8. The rise of conductors - Jos&eacute; Antonio Bowen9. The central European tradition - Jos&eacute; Antonio Bowen and Raymond Holden10. The French tradition - David Cairns11. The Italian tradition - Michael Rose12. The American tradition - Jos&eacute; Antonio Bowen and David Mermelstein13. The English tradition - Stephen Johnson14. The Russian tradition - David NicePart III. Issues:15. The conductor as Artistic Director - Bramwell Tovey [if you're aware of his work you will need no further encouragement]16. Women on the podium - Michelle Edwards17. Conducting early music - Bernard Sherman [that's me]18. Training conductors - Harold Faberman [Perhaps America's leading teacher of conductors; his own book on conducting technique is outstanding]19. The composer/conductor and modern music - Martyn Brabbins20. Managers and the business of conduction - Stephen Wright21. The future of conducting - Leon Botstein.[Again - need I say more? Fascinating chapter by this extraordinary conductor/scholar/university president.]"

This fine, durable Dover edition nicely complements Dover's &quot;Piano Masterpieces of Maurice Ravel&quot; with no overlap to give a nearly complete collection of all of Ravel's compositions for the piano. The only piano work absent from both volumes is the Habanera, probably because that work is almost invariably performed by two pianists, although I own a transcription for a single player. Many of the works in this volume are quite accessible to pianists of intermediate skill, if they are sufficiently motivated by a love of the music of Ravel, and even in Le tombeau, a work of legendary difficulty, the exquisite Menuet, should prove playable by all but beginners. Highly recommended."

Young ""artist""",10/10,5.0,1036195200,An Impressive Set of Works and More,"This book contains a great selection of pieces at a more than resonable price. I bought it as a set with Piano Masterpieces of Maurice Ravel also by Dover. (I saw another edition of Ma Mere l'Oye *on it's own* was more than what I paid for this whole book!) Dover editions I have found in the past have great quality. The pages are sewn in so the book will last a lifetime without pages falling or ripping out.If you're not already impressed by the selection of pieces (I love the 1913 Prelude which I already had a copy of and memorized a while ago), Dover goes even further with this set. It opens with the table of contents and after that it has a complete glossyry of french terms and text used in the music! This I found was quite impressive. Even Dover's other Ravel book doesn't do this. Some of the terms sound enough like English words or Italian musical terms for you to figure it out but it's really great that they gave you it there for you to know for certain. Following that are translations of the wonderful quotes of fairy tales from La Mere and other text that appears in the book.Before each multi-movement piece it receives it's own cover page followed by an introduction to the piece written by Ronald Herder citing Orenstein's book Ravel: Man and Musician as a primary source. It is really nice to learn a little about the piece before playing it and it's a wonderful inclusion. The music appears to be in chronological order with the three 1913 pieces grouped together under a single cover sheet (sans any introduction). The title piece is well deserving of it as it is a large section of the book with it's 7 movements. The book concludes with Ravel's transcription of La Valse. It is annotated with Ravel's own notes on the orchestra version sometimes including a third ossia staff showing parts of the orchestration unincluded in the transcription. Instruments are named in french and can be translated via the glossary at the front of the book.The only problem anyone might have with this book is that there are no noted fingerings as far as I've seen. I don't rely on them much myself but I know other people prefer them. If that is an issue, consider still getting this book and consulting someone on parts where you are unsure of the best fingering. Otherwise this is the perfect set!"

Each piece is given an introduction, and all of the French terms are translated in a glossary near the front. This is especially helpful for those of us who aren't great with French. The music is clean and neatly spaced, and it looks vibrant and new. Like a previous reviewer said, the only minor flaw is that no fingerings are included, and of course using the right fingerings and hand positions is crucial in Ravel. There are also few typographical errors in the music, probably because these are later works by Ravel.If you want fingerings and performance suggestions for Le Tombeau de Couperin, I would suggest Nancy Bricard's edition from Alfred. In particular, the Toccata and the Prelude are good pieces to have suggested fingerings for."

That is a good question, and if you think the answer is ""we don't"", just try convincing publishers of that.Would I buy this one? It would not be worth my book-dollars in light of better reference works out there.Having said that, I'll review this book as though I don't already own 20 reference books on the same subject.Losch moves in alphabetical order through a description of about 75 places, regions, cities, and towns. The majority of entries receive between 1-3 pages each.The positive qualities:(1) The page layout is eye-pleasing.(2) The actual writing is good. For a reference work, the style is lively.(3) Lesser-known places in Palestine are given new light. For example, do you know what Palestinian town/city is mentioned the most, second only to Jerusalem? Bethel. And what about Peniel? It is only mentioned once in the Bible, but still gets a full page. Nob gets a nod too.(4) A good number of the places are outside of Palestine.(5) Some of the places are not even mentioned in the Bible. For example, Qumran, Sepphoris, and Nabatea.Negative aspects:(1) Reference works are normally written by an entire host of authors, and as a result are able to pull from the scholarly minds of many rather than one.(2) Almost no pictures whatsover. Just a few B&W; shots of inconsequential things (i.e. some shepherds with sheep). I think the publication budget should have received a few more dollars. A picture is worth the proverbial 1,000 words. On one hand, maybe I shouldn't fault a book for what it doesn't claim to be - an illustrated reference work - and yet, one of the purposes of the review is to inform you of whether this is money well-spent. Not including pictures severely limits this book from rising to the top of the pile."

Though the setting is far removed in time (far, at least for a small child), the characters and situations remain appealing and true, particularly the relationships between younger and older sisters.This is just an ideal book to read to a child too young to read it -- the series grows with the person, so that after a few years the child can read on her own, and Betsy and Tacy can keep her company all the way through high school."

They were no older than I was when they met. Tacy's family had just moved to Hill Street in Deep Valley, Minnesota. Betsy lived with her parents and older sister Julia. Betsy had felt a bit left out as far as friends was concerned. There were plenty of children of Julia's age or were merely infants but none of Betsy's age. That all changed when Tacy's family moved into town. Initially Betsy's encounter with Tacy was not how Betsy wanted it to be. It wasn't until Betsy's birthday party did the duo become fast friends.""Betsy-Tacy"" remains a personal favorite in the childrens series. It was so well written. Maude Hart Lovelace did a exquisite job at describing the death of Tacy's baby sister which was so real and heartbreaking. I also loved the chapter on the piano box. I just love how Maude Hart Lovelace captured the essence and magic of childhood perfectly. She didn't sugarcoat it nor did she dumb down her stories.

In the late afternoon, my father arrived home from work, having made a stop on the way, at the library. He'd asked the librarian for recommendations of books that might be fun for me to read while I was sick. He brought a few books, and I had so much fun reading them, getting immersed in the stories and characters; BETSY-TACY was my favorite, which I quickly followed with BETSY, TACY & TIBB, and, eventually, the other books in the series, progressing nicely, to coincide with a reader's aging and abilities. That evening was the first time I remember that connection and joy happening, from reading on my own. All through the years, visiting and spending time at libraries constituted a frequent and deeply pleasurable element of our family's life, with our mom or (more often) dad, my three siblings and me.

The book is a mere 634 pages, that is, two thirds as long as Copperfield but a 100 pages longer than The Old Curiosity Shop. One of Dickens' strong points is atmosphere, and this novel is one of his best in that department. His description of the Maypole Inn and its proprietor, slow John, is marvelous. Much of the book describes the riots and their effect on various characters. Barnaby himself is an idiot, but such an excellent character for all that. The villians actually have good qualities in this book. And by the way, the Raven Grip is supposedly the model for Poe's raven. I would not start reading Dickens with Barnaby, but even though it's not as well known as ten other of his novels, I can highly recommend if you like other Dickens to give this book a read.

It's one of his shorter books, and it was written earlier on in his career. The book is really not where a reader should start with Dickens' books, but it should be read nonetheless. It still has the same great characterizations and atmosphere that we expect from Dickens, and it's still a good story. Barnaby is quite the character.

Although not as grippingly exciting as Dicken's other historical novel, A Tale Of Two Cities, there is plenty of drama here to sustain the reader's interest.The fictional characters are well woven into the historical setting, and the portrayal of these characters gives the book some of its best comic moments, from the suave Edward Chester, to the vengeful Simon Tappertit, to the spiteful Miss Miggs, to the devious hangman, Dennis. The hero of the book is Gabriel Varden, whom Dickens repeatedly describes, rather clumsily, as &quot;the honest locksmith&quot;. Varden has to suffer constant friction in his own household between himself, his wife, his apprentice and his maid, and this agitation reflects the agitation of the masses in the streets.One of the best features of the book is the way it successfully carries a number of plot lines. The main one of these concerns a murder committed many years previously for which no-one has been convicted. There are several other sub-plots such as the tension between the Catholic Haredale and the Protestant Chester, Joe Willet's love for Varden's daughter, the comical scheming of the apprentice locksmith against his master and the presence of a shadowy stranger who pursues Barnaby Rudge's mother. Some elements of the plot fizzle out a bit too easily towards the end, such as the attempt to kidnap Haredale's daughter, but the overall effect of the book is very satisfying.This is one of Dicken's least remembered novels, but I think it is well worth reading and an excellent introduction to his work."

Barnaby Rudge is a very different animal from the 4 prior novels, patterned after it was on the swashbuckling historical style of Scott. It's so different from Old Curiosity Shop, which he was writing at the same time as Barnaby Rudge, that it's hard to believe it's the work of the same author, except for the quality of exceptionally vivid characterizations that pervade all the books.I knew nothing of the historical events upon which the book is based, that, at the time of original publication, were well known to most Londoners, almost as well known as 9/11 is known by contemporary New Yorkers. Dickens seemed to have anticipated this problem, as the historical recreation is so beautifully folded into the melodrama that I never felt left behind. DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION as too many plot points were given away and spoiled some of the dramatic impact for this reader. Save the introduction for afterward.The characters are so memorable, it is painful to have to complete the book and say goodbye to them. Especially John Willet, and his double-chin, which almost deserves billing as a character in and of itself, Sir John Chester, a poetic achievement to whom Oscar Wilde and Shaw owed enormous debts, Maypole Hugh, and Grip the Raven (from whom Poe got his idea for the poem ""The Raven), are high water marks of achievement.While I preferred some of the intensely personal, experimental style of the latter half of Oliver Twist and much of Old Curiosity Shop, the confident and bold tone of the narration in Barnaby is a shot of adrenaline in every chapter, and the power of description in Dicken's cinematic viewpoint is incredibly powerful and pulse-poundingly entertaining, while the whole time maintaing a savvy, but never cynical outlook when it comes to the socio-political themes.Don't miss it."

Go mad.""","Focused primarily on the ""anti-popery"" riots in London in1780, and filled with wild scenes of carnage involving a large cast of characters from all levels of society, Barnaby Rudge is Dickens's first historical novel, and it includes the real Lord George Gordon, a virulent anti-Catholic who whipped the populace into a frenzy. The author sets the scene for the tumult by first painting a picture of quiet village society in Chigwell in 1775, five years earlier, often using humor to depict the numerous characters.Geoffrey Haredale, a Catholic, has inherited the estate of his brother Reuben, who was murdered twenty-two years before. He has brought up his niece Emma, who is in love with the kindly Edward Chester, a Protestant, the son of the odious Lord John Chester, who lives nearby. Dozens of characters populate the book--including Barnaby Rudge (the developmentally disabled son of Mary Rudge, who works on an estate), the Willetts (who run the Maypole Inn), Gabriel Varden (a locksmith) and his daughter Dolly (who eventually works for Emma Haredale), mysterious strangers, ghosts, a sinister blind man, and even Grip, Barnaby's talking raven.The action takes off when the time shifts from 1775 to 1780, and the focus changes from village life and the sometimes amusing domestic concerns of the people to the growing anti-Catholic sentiment being stirred up in London. The humor, which has been a big part of the first part of the book, ends, and Dickens concentrates on the growing hatred and the battles spawned by that hatred, with good people being drawn into brutality that they would otherwise avoid. Violence and several deaths take place, the populace becomes a mob, and rioting leads to the burning of properties. The love stories, which have been a large part of the first section of the book, are put on the back burner for the major part of the book.Written in 1841, this is Dickens's fifth novel, one which suffers from its original serialization and loss of focus. Though the atmosphere and some of the characters rank among Dickens's best, and some of the humor in the first part is delightful, the tone is inconsistent, changing with the riots and ensuing action. As is always the case with Dickens, all mysteries are cleared up at the end, with Reuben Haredale's murder solved and the whereabouts revealed of several characters who disappeared between 1775 and 1780. With hints of some of the greatness to come, this novel precedes David Copperfield, Bleak House, and A Tale of Two Cities, and shows Dickens experimenting with his themes and ideas. n Mary Whipple"

When I finally read it I was amazed it had taken me so long. It turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected from the blurb on the book.Like all Dickens' novels, the characters are drawn to show the nature of human beings, and he does it so well, the characters could be set in modern day and the story would still work. We see the shifty lecherous rogue who covets the beautiful young lady, the dedicated hangman, and the patriotic family man. We see troubled family relationships: mother and son, father and daughter, and father and son. Most important of all, we see the title character, a golden-hearted idiot whose simple-minded exuberance makes him a ready-made pawn for the devious and evil manipulators who stand to profit from division and resentment between Catholics and Protestants.Perhaps the most timeless thing about this novel is the willful manufacturing of resentment between the two primary social political groups of the time. You could simply replace the terms Catholic and Protestant with Liberal and Conservative and you'd be telling our modern story. Turn on the nightly news and you will see a modern-day Barnaby Rudge there enthusiastically reciting the talking points of some divisive talk-show host, all the while completely oblivious that he is but a pawn dutifully serving a sinister master. I'm glad I waited until now to read this tale of Dickens because it's such a timely reminder of human impulse toward the mob mentality.Barnaby Rudge is an ever present reminder that if we lose our ability to think to think critically, we our own identity and our values will be consumed to serve the desires of someone else."

In my view, nothing could be more timely.Most people have not read this book which was never as popular as some of Dickens' other novels, such as Oliver Twist or David Copperfield. However, this historical novel of a tragic period in English history of the late 18th century, was early on a project Dickens wanted to present. Work on it predated his widely popular Pickwick Papers, on a much more serious subject.It was the religious riots of 1780, precipitated by an unstable member of the House of Lords, Lord George Gordon, who wanted to suppress catholicism, even among members of his own monied class. The cause of ""No Popery"" was taken up by mob rule which resulted in a horrendous amount of death and loss of property among all the people of London, including the burning of Newgate prison, Bedlam, the hospital for the insane, and many houses of rich and poor alike.As in all Dickens books, there is a cause that the author wants to present and explore. And this one seems to be an analysis of how mob rule occurs and how people who have little factual information destroy and disrupt both the rule of law and the faculty of common sense. If this were only a historical condition, the novel might be of interest. But, we can easily see how today around the world, the incitement of a few with dubious motives can destroy and disorient the lives of the many. Find a discussion group and read it together!"

The novel is the most obscure work by the master. The story is well worth reading. It is an exciting story of the Anti-Roman Catholic riots of 1780 led by the eccentric George Gordon a member of Parliament. The second half of the book focuses on the riots in a cinematic depiction of the mobs who ran amok in London during a hot summer of hatred, prejudice and murder.Character rather than complicated Victorian plot is why we read Dickens. This book adds many memorable folks to the gallery of Dickenscharacters. In this long novel we meet:Barnaby Rudge-the title character is a feeble witted lad whose pet is the famed raven Grip. He lives with his mother. We later learn his evil father Rudge Sr. murdered Lord Haredale's brother. The father is hanged but Barnaby lives to spend time at the Maypole Inn. Years before Dostoevsky's novel ""The Idiot"" Dickens took a mentally ill person as his hero. Barnaby is pardoned for his participation in the Gordon riots.Gabriel Varden, his shrewish wife and buxom daughter Dolly live in London where Mr. Varden is a locksmith. After Joe Willet leaves England to fight in the American Revolution he returns home to wed Dolly. A charming love story.The Haredale family tells us of the love of Mr. Haredale's beautiful nieceEmma for Edward the son of John Chester. Chester is a Protestant and a sworn enemy of the Catholic Haredales.Minor charactes such as Hugh (the illegitimate son of Chester); Dennis the hangman; Miss Miggs the man crazy maid to Mrs. Varden and others populate the pages of this fast paced tale of murder,mystery and intrigue.Barnaby Rudge is a fine book which deserves to be better known. It is not Dickens best novel,his longest novel or his most famous novel. Yet it still appeals in its exciting look at the events of 1780. It and the much more famous Tale of Two Cities were the two historical novels the author produced.YOu will never forget Grip the Raven (said to be the inspiration for Edgar Allen Poe's poem ""The Raven"") or Barnaby and his friends and enemies. Curl up with this good book and let your mind and heart wander back to the year of our Lord 1775 when the novel begins.The book is well illustrated by George Cattermole and Hablot K.

As always, the characters are varied, and spring to life through Dickens's gifts for acute description and memorable dialogue. The plot threads are complex - some admittedly predictable, others full of suspense and surprise. What I appreciate most, however, is the action-packed, central section of the book with its vivid descriptions of the Gordon Riots: terrifying, out-of-control mob violence engendered by religious intollerance. Given the the disasterous effects of rigid religious fundamentalism (across all the major faiths) in the contemporary world, I found this aspect of the novel the most compelling. Add to that the character of the amoral, hypocritical politician Sir John Chester, and we have a work of fiction to remind us that there are lessons to be learned from history. With its relative brevity, compelling ncharacters, and page-turning action sequences, I highly recommend this novel to fans of the author and those new to his oeuvre."

I decided, a year or so ago, to read some Dickens and see what I thought. This book wouldn't have hooked me, but I'd already read enough stuff to know that this isn't his best. Though it wasn't that good, there were elements of it that were interesting, and that kept me going long enough that I finished it.Barnaby Rudge is a simple man with a talking crow. His mother looks after him. He lives in a world full of people who are more or less friends, or at least acquaintances. Among these are a tavern keeper and his son, a locksmith and his wife and daughter, the locksmith's apprentice, and the locksmith's maid. The book spends several hundred pages on exposition of these characters, with you getting to know more and more about them as the story progresses. The interplay of the characters, with the author interweaving so many plotlines, is apparently a trademark of Dickens, and he puts it on display here, using it for all it's worth. At about the halfway point of the book the plot begins to form, as one of the secondary characters, a British nobleman named Gordon, decides to foment anti-Catholic sentiment because it will bring him political prominence. Of course riots will result, of course people will be killed, and of course Gordon thinks nothing of this, because he's advancing his political career at the same time. Barnaby and the other central characters in the book are caught up in the riots, and their aftermath, and that forms the main plot of the story.I generally enjoyed this book, but I thought the exposition too long (by modern standards anyway) the plot itself too wordy, and the ending I'm afraid was predictable. What saves the book is the characters. On that logic alone I might recommend it."

If you only want to read Dickens' finest books that show his best talents, you may do better to stick with books like &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; or &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; All of that aside, I can not understand why this never gained the same popularity as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (which also shows a departure from Dickens' standard formula). The opening is quite captivating and the images are well painted. Right away Dickens grabs our attention with the mysterious 'dead man' (who will later prove to be a VERY significant live person). Like Dickens' other villains, Chester is very wicked, but he carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Geoffrey Haredale is a captivating figure who APPEARS cold, but he proves himself to be quite virtuous. Although we don't really get to know Emma and Dolly that well, they do grab our attention at times. Mary (Barnaby Rudge's mother) is memorable as a (widowed?) woman who does her best for her son and displays her fears dramatically. The 'dead man' reappears every now and then to keep us in suspense. The conversations between Ned and his father Chester are quite memorable. Varden is fine in his secondary but significant role. Barnaby is not exactly Dickens' most memorable protagonist, but he does portray someone caught in the middle fairly well. One thing Dickens does quite well is that he first draws personal disputes over religion, and then he draws civil riots over religious differences. Some memorable lines are also present: (&quot;I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands,&quot; &quot;May he die a violent death as I do now and have the night wind as his only mourner.&quot;). The final fight between Chester and Haredale is a fitting conclusion for this excellent work. So we have a great combination of drama, suspense, horror, and even some comedy. My only complaints about this are that I feel some more time could have been spent on the 'dead man' in developing his character and explaining his actions, and I do miss the filial piety that is prevalent in other novels of Dickens. I do not feel that this represents Dickens' best efforts; but it is FAR from his worst creation. This is every bit as good as the popular &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;"

But Dickens wrote another historical novel 18 years before, in 1841, the complex and colorful &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, set during London's anti-Papal riots of June 1780, when there was a reaction against the Catholic influence in Parliament. Populated by a large cast and activated by a plot of intrigue and danger, it is one of the best of Dickens in his early period. In fact, it is perhaps Dickens' most under-rated work. As usual with Dickens, the characters find themselves in a labyrinth of relationships. Sir John Chester is an impoverished habitu&eacute; who tells his handsome son he expects the young man to insure the family fortune in the time-honored tradition of decadent nobility: by marrying money. &quot;With regard to our circumstances, Ned, you may set your mind at rest upon that score. They are desperate.&quot; His son is appalled, the more so as he is in love with Emma, the daughter of a country gentleman, Geoffrey Haredale, Sir John's moral opposite. Running parallel to this love story is that of Joe Willet, the good-hearted son of John Willet, the proprietor of the Maypole Inn, where much of the action takes place. Joe is courting the daughter of Gabriel Varden, an honest, hard-working locksmith, a proletarian hero. (Originally he was the book's title character.) Gabriel's daughter Dolly, Joe's inamorata, is one of those human cookies so adored by Victorian England. (All through the 19th Century articles of clothing were named after her: the Dolly Varden bonnet, the Dolly Varden cape, etc.) Touching these families is Barnaby Rudge himself, a strange, simple-minded boy whose navet&eacute; leads him into joining the rebellion led by the Protestant radical Lord George Gordon, who also appears as a minor character. Barnaby's constant companion is a talking raven; their conversations sound like vaudeville routines. His mother hides one of those dark family mysteries Dickens used so suspensefully in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;; and this theme is reflected in Sir John Chester's secret: he is the illegitimate father of ... the story's least likely character. The novel is filled with Dickensian trademarks: ironic drama, an odd sense of humor, and, of course, strong sentimentality. With the bloody Gordon riots as a climax, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, elaborate and absorbing, is an impressive predecessor to Dickens' better-known tale of the Reign of Terror."

Reilly,4/4,4.0,1266019200,Ignore the academic opinion,"Admittedly a lesser known work by Dickens, I found it a great read. Sure, it's a bit slow in the early chapters, but what part of any Dickens work doesn't have its moments. The cast of characters is diverse, as usual, and bring different social circumstances to the Gordon Riots in 1780 England. The chapters devoted to the Riot itself are packed with action that kept me reading far past my normal quitting time. More importantly, Dickens paints a vivid picture of both religious persecution and the irrational and unpredictable quality of a widespread riot. With brief references to the War for Independence, the novel serves as a solid insight into some of the thinking that led our Founding Fathers to enshrine fundamental liberties in the Bill of Rights.The academic review that precedes the novel is a waste of time for any reader for enjoyment and a perfect example of the horrid quality of writing in academia today. The reviewer needs to spend less time assembling critical comment and spend some time learning how to write like Dickens."

The book is interesting, full of the kind of characters that Dickens is noted for, and full of action and exciting scenes. More significantly, it is one of his most thought provoking works, with a relevance that is applicable to today's world. It will leave you cheering for the good guys and grateful to see that the bad guys (and gals) get what coming to them. The book is divided cleanly into two parts, the first taking place in 1775, depicts the comings and goings of four families and their assorted relations and friends. The second occurs five years later and focuses on an historical event, the riots which shook London to oppose rights for Catholics.The book begins at the Maypole, an inn located just outside London and presided over by John Willet, a pompous know-it-all who intimidates his friends and dominates his son, Joe, to the point that he leaves to join the army by the end of this part. Hugh, an uneducated and violent man works for Willet handling animals. Down the road is the residence of Geoffrey Haredale, a country gentleman, and his niece Emma, a beautiful and gracious girl. Her father was mysteriously killed 22 years previously and the mystery runs through the book. Haredale is a Catholic and an antagonist to John Chester, an oily, Machiavellian, highly ambitious character. The only thing the two men have in common is their mutual desire to keep Chester's son Edward from a romance with Emma. In this they succeed and Edward, too, leaves at the end of part 1. The third household contains the Varden family. Gabriel, the father, is a locksmith kindly and a moderating influence throughout the book. Ultimately he plays a hero's role. His wife, Martha, constants nags him, aided and abetted by their servant, Miss Miggs, a comical character given to hysterics. Their daughter, Dolly, is beautiful and vivacious, but flirtatious and at this point does not return the love that Joe Willet shows for her. Simon Tappertit, an apprentice to Mr. Varden, also resides there. He is a ridiculous person with an exaggerated sense of himself and the clandestine leader of a group of similar apprentices with designs on engaging in violence against their masters. Finally there is the residence of the title character, Barnaby Rudge, who is a mentally deficient but happy and charming young man. He lives in genteel poverty with his mother. Mr. Rudge, who was the steward to the murdered Mr. Haredale, was also allegedly a victim. The cast of characters interacts in typical Dickens fashion for the first 33 (of 80) chapters.The scene and mood shifts abruptly in the second part which gives a detailed and graphic account of the so-called ""anti-popery"" riots that took place in London in 1780. The reader would do well to read an independent account of these events before reading Dickens' version. The above cast of characters is joined in part two by an additional group including some from actual life (Lord George Gordon, the instigator of the riots and Ned Dennis, one of the ringleaders to name but two). The riots bring out the best and the worst of all the characters. Barnaby is conned into joining the rioters and ends up in prison condemned to be hanged, the Maypole Inn is sacked and John Willet, humiliated, bound and gagged, the Haredale residence is set ablaze and Emma and Dolly taken prisoner, many houses are burned, people killed, Newgate prison is broken into, destroyed and all the prisoners released. The riots end with a harrowing scene is which dozens of people are burned to death by flaming alcohol.The execution scene, where three of the ""ringleaders"" are to be hanged is one of the most powerful parts of the book. Dickens gives a vivid account of the conditions and circus atmosphere that surrounds this event. In Hugh's powerful and eloquent speech Dickens also gives a condemnation of British society that creates such persons. Hugh at this point is the most moral person in the book and goes to his death with bravery and courage. This scene alone is well worth reading the book for.In the end, of course, everything is sorted out, justice is delayed but not denied and we have a happy ending.If the book can be said to suffer it is from the lack of a strong central character around whom the plot revolves. There is no real hero here or even a singular villain. Joe and Edward, either of whom might have filled the former role are largely absent from much of the book and only show up again after the riots have ended. Gabriel Varden comes closest to that role but is more acted upon than actor until the closing chapters. The most likely candidate for villain, John Chester, likewise disappears at the end of part one. Hugh, Simon and Dennis emerge as a trio of rouges joined by Gashford, secretary to Lord Gordon and a blind man who cries plaintively, why must I be good just because I am blind? The murderer, of course, is also lurking around. But none of these individuals stands apart from the rest and the hero versus villain theme is muted. The book is really about events and how these events shape and change the life of the characters for better or worse.In the end you will find yourself thinking about Barnaby Rudge for days afterward and it will leave a mark on your life. Nothing more positive can be said about any book."

Lafitte, a Dickens Fan Who Has Tried Them All","This is the last of all the Dickens's novels (including the five shorter Christmas Books) that I have either read or attempted. I had saved it until the last because it has not been held in very high esteem either by the critics or the reading public. I was pleasantly surprised.Whereas there are several Dickens novels that I was unable to finish (namely, The Old Curiosity Shop, Martin Chuzzlewit, Dombey and Son, Little Dorrit, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and all the Christmas Books except A Christmas Carol), Barnaby Rudge never dragged even though it is one of Dickens's longer novels. Barnaby Rudge is as filled with memorable characters (especially the secondary ones - Miss Miggs, the Vardens, the Chesters, Hugh, Mr. Tappertitt, Dennis the hangman, etc.); places (the Maypole Inn, the locksmith's shop) and incident (the Gordon Riots) as any of his greater novels.Stylistically, Barnaby Rudge is akin to Dickens's earlier picaresque novels (Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby). After those early successes of the 1830s, Dickens was struggling to find his mature style in my opinion. Most of the longer and shorter novels I was unable to finish come from the 1840s. (The Mystery of Edwin Drood is Dickens's last novel, but it was only half-finished at his death so it is really not fair to blame Dickens for my failure to respond to it.) Even though The Old Curiosity Shop comes between Nicholas Nickelby and Barnaby Rudge, Barnaby Rudge demonstrates all the strengths of Nicholas Nickelby and avoids the weaknesses of The Old Curiosity Shop. Barnaby Rudge is still early Dickens in my opinion.G. K. Chesterton described a taste for early Dickens as similar to a taste for new potatoes as opposed to mature potatoes. Some people prefer new potatoes. Barnaby Rudge is not Dickens at his greatest. (I reserve that description for David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Bleak House. Along with the three novels of the 1830s already mentioned, I place Hard Times, A Tale of Two Cities and Our Mutual Friend and now, Barnaby Rudge, on the second tier of Dickens's novels.) We must remember, that Dickens at his worst is better than most writers at their best. If Barnaby Rudge were a newly discovered work by an otherwise unknown author, or by one of Dickens's contemporaries, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. As it is, Barnaby Rudge is an eminently enjoyable and readable effort by a great writer."

B00089ZPHG,"The citizen of the world, or, Letters from a Chinese philosopher residing in London to his friends in the East (Select British classics)",,AAW58LG72PG7I,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""",1/1,5.0,1267488000,Biting Satire Under the Guise of Rationality,"Lien Chi Altangi is a Chinese visitor to England who tours the country and passes witty judgments on Englishmen and their mores which he sends back to Peking in the form of letters. Tonight, he and a companion, identified only as the Man in Black, attend a live theater performance. Letter XXI contains his impressions of that performance. He begins by noting that though both the English and Chinese dearly love their theater, their respective cultural attitudes toward dramaturgy point out some vast ideological differences. English theater is performed indoors, at night, and is of short duration. Chinese theater is acted outdoors, in the daylight, and is of very long duration.The Man in Black is a regular in several of Altangi's letters, and he is often used as a mouthpiece to counterbalance what Altangi sees as invariable laws of nature in China, but elsewhere as in England these laws are quite variable. What catches Altangi's eye is the seating of the spectators. The cheapest seats occupy the highest level, a fact that astonishes him in that the reverse is true in China. Those who sit in such seats act loudly, often speaking both to one another and to the performers. The middle seats, more expensive than the former but cheaper than the highest price lodgings, hold those who seem to enjoy eating oranges as least as much as watching the show. Then there are the most expensive seats, filled by the affluent who sit in the lowest rows. Such wealthy theater-goers act more nobly if not haughtily: ""They seemed to consider themselves as judges of the merit of the poet and the performers."" Their collective attitudes reveal their inherent belief that the clods who sit above them are cretins, and that only true patrons of the arts, like themselves, may harbor elevated theatrical discernment. Altangi's exalted opinion of the affluent's grasp of histrionics is tempered by the Man in Black's snide comment that ""not one in an hundred of them knew even the first principles of criticism"" Such self-appointed critics of the arts hold that position only by default since ""there was none to contradict their pretensions.""Altangi's view of everyone in the audience ranged from incredulity to disgust. Those misguided souls who wished to interact with the performers were in his opinion ""acting parts in dumb show, not a curtsey, or nod, that was not the result of art; not a look nor a smile that was not designed for murder."" He is clearly upset with their amatory habits of public displays of affection: ""Gentlemen and ladies ogled each other through spectacles.""When the play begins (possibly a reference to John Home's Douglas (1757)), the actors enter, and Altangi shows surprise at the applause shown, a custom which seems absurd to him. The first actor on the stage is the queen who receives much loud applause. It seems incongruous to Altangi that the queen is receiving what he deems undeserved plaudits from the audience. She weeps and laments over issues that he considers trifles. The king enters and shows physical affection, which she quickly rejects. Altangi wonders why the king lacks a certain amatory discretion. For no reason at all, a third actor enters the stage, balancing a straw upon his nose. Altangi hears the crowd applaud noisily and cannot comprehend the logic behind this. The Man in Black unhelpfully replies: ""This is one of the most important characters of the whole play."" Altangi still sees no reason for the straw on the nose.At the beginning of the third act, a self-professed villain struts on stage, loudly proclaiming his villainy. Altangi notes that in Chinese drama, all villains are far more circumspect about their evil intentions. Following the entrance and exit of the villain, a child of six years strolled on stage and inexplicably began to dance, an act ""which gave the ladies and mandarins infinite satisfaction."" Puzzled yet once again, Altangi can conclude only that ""Dancing being, I presume, as contemptible here as it is in China."" The Man in Black counters that ""Dancing is a very reputable and genteel employment."" The higher that a dancer can kick, the greater will be his salary, he sagely advises.In the fourth act, the queen produces her son and promptly tells the audience that her son would be a better king than her husband. When her husband learns her intentions, he orders the immediate execution of the son. The queen faints as the curtain drops. In the concluding fifth act, there is no further mention made of any of these plot complications, so Altangi has no knowledge of their collective lamentable fates.As Altangi walks out of the theater, he tries to make some sense of the performance. The entire cast seemed afflicted with an endless series of ill-conceived woes. He asserts that English tragedies are overly focused on divergent passions. Chinese dramatists more properly assign subordinate and logical passions at precisely the right moment. After reaching this conclusion, Altangi bids his companion good night and heads home.In the many letters that comprise The Citizen of the World, Oliver Goldsmith, using the persona of a Chinese traveler to England, examines English society and customs in a way that permits him to stick satirical barbs into a myriad of inviting targets. Goldsmith was well aware of the reputation for logic and reason that the Chinese were reputed to possess. Thus, however outrageous were the comments of Altangi, Goldsmith assumed that his readers would not be so quick to dismiss their veracity and applicability. In Letter XXI, Goldsmith examines what he saw as some eccentricities of the English stage. In Altangi's view, Goldsmith forces his readers to examine their beloved stage productions as they might have appeared to those thoroughly disposed to reason and logic. Goldsmith spares no aspect of the English stage. From the length of the typical English tragedy to the structure of the theater and finally to the spectators observing a weird blend of drama and melodramatic nonsense, Goldsmith exposes the unbalanced underside of a theater of which even cultured Englishmen may have been blissfully unaware. Many of Altangi's comments smack of biting satire, especially since these comments seem so naturally articulated that they are voiced in the persona of one who is in logical command of his thoughts. The Man in Black is the counterweight to Altangi, with the former representing the attitudes of orthodox English society. Goldsmith limits the comments of the Man in Black to unsuccessful retorts to the infinitely more reasonable views of Altangi. Goldsmith also cannot resist taking several cheap shots at his most reviled of targets--literary critics. As he comments on the loud diatribes of the supposedly educated elite who hurl unwanted and unintelligible vitriol from their expensive seats at the stage actors, Goldsmith clearly has in mind those critics who do likewise from the comparable safety of their assorted theater reviews. In this letter, as in nearly any of his other writings, Goldsmith shows a shocking lack of self-awareness in that he was the identical sort of critic that he savaged routinely in those same writings. What readers take away from the totality of letters from his The Citizen of the World is the view of a man who wished to reveal the illogical and often disagreeable underside of a society that he saw as his own but needed to be frequently exposed to the cleansing light of the sun, a process that could be achieved only through his pen."

But that is what Adam Rapp does best: tell stories that are at once despairing, brutal, true, and hopeful.Like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, this is a retrospective story told by a resident of a mental (and, in this case, drug rehab) institution, but Steve has been through a lot more than just getting kicked out of boarding school. Steve is a Gray Grouper at Burnstone Grove, neither a drug addict nor suicidal, but someone who cracked slowly under too many stresses. He lost his mother, and then his brother; through these deaths, when Steve needed him the most, his father became more distant.With an unapologetic eye for detail, Rapp takes us through Steve's discovery of his brother's dead body and the crimes he commits afterwards. Instead of revulsion, we as readers feel sympathy for Steve, who is as sensitive and captivating as he is observant and honest, a good person in a series of bad situations. The supporting characters --- including Mary, the beautiful pianist Steve has a crush on, and Shannon Lynch, a manipulative resident of Burnstone Grove who can put $1.87 in change up his nose --- add color and dimension to Steve's experiences.There is humor here for those who need to laugh in the most difficult situations and hope for those who need some kind of happy ending. It is a serious but never melodramatic book that will stay with you once it's finished, and will spark thought and pathos. In this reviewer's opinion, UNDER THE WOLF, UNDER THE DOG is one of the best books of 2004.--- Reviewed by Carlie Webber"

It's a heartbreakingly beautiful story told from the point of view of a 19-year-old boy who is in a home for kids who are drug addicts and/or have tried to commit suicide. It is the ""journal"" he is asked to keep that forms the novel. It is devastating in its honesty. The point of view is extraordinary, both raw and lyric. The narrator has an intensely personal sense of humor and of the absurd. As tragic as the novel is, it is also very, very funny. I think this is one of the best and most intelligent novels I have read in a long time. It is certainly one I will never forget."

B000NZOATO,The Face in the Abyss,,AD4XBTBQYQBT3,s.ferber,9/10,3.0,1080259200,A BOOK OF REAL MERRITT,"Abraham Merritt's &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; first appeared as a short story in a 1923 issue of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine. It would be another seven years before its sequel, &quot;The Snake Mother,&quot; appeared in &quot;Argosy,&quot; and yet another year before the book-length version combined these two tales, in 1931. It is easy to detect the book's provenance as two shorter stories, as the first third of the novel is pretty straightforward treasure-hunting fare, while the remainder of the book takes a sharp turn into lost-world fantasy, of the kind popularized by H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this novel we meet Nick Graydon, an American miner, who is searching for lost Incan loot with three of the nastiest compadres you can imagine. In the Peruvian wastes, they come across a mysterious girl, and are led by her toward Yu-Atlanchi, the so-called Hidden Land. Graydon's cohorts suffer a mysterious fate, but Graydon himself goes on to discover Yu-Atlanchi's many wonders. He meets the Snake Mother, one of Merritt's finest creations: a half snake/half girl entity who is countless aeons old and possessed of ancient wisdom. The Snake Mother is similar in nature to the Silent Ones of Merritt's first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; but is a much more fleshed-out character. It seems that Graydon has stumbled into Yu-Atlanchi just as civil war is about to break out there. Nimir, an evil lord whom the Snake Mother had imprisoned ages ago, has returned, and is intent on using his weapons of mind control and superscience to rule the world. Merritt does ultimately treat us to a nifty battle between the forces of Nimir (aided by his lizard men, dinosaurs and various weapons) and the Snake Mother (aided by her invisible flying lizards and assorted way-out armaments). But before we get to that battle, Merritt also dishes out a dinosaur hunt, a dinosaur race, a tour through the Cavern of Lost Wisdom, a garden of evil, mind control, spirit possession, spider-men (and NOT of the Peter Parker variety!), and some fascinating history of and philosophizing by the Snake Mother. It's all wonderfully pulpy and improbable stuff, but Merritt throws quite a bit into the book to keep the reader well entertained.On the down side, &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; does not feature as much of the wonderful purple prose that made earlier Merritt works such as &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster&quot; so special. This book seems to have been written more quickly and, in some places, almost carelessly. For example, in one scene, the moon is said to be rising from the west! In another, Graydon is said to have only one pistol, under his arm, although the pistol he's had at his waist is never mentioned again. That Cavern of Lost Wisdom seems so easy to come across that it's impossible for the reader to believe that it has been undiscovered for thousands of years. Merritt is also guilty of occasional fuzzy writing in &quot;Face&quot; (such as when he refers to a &quot;three foot parapet&quot;; is that three feet high or three feet wide, or what?), and much of the geography of the incessant tunnel crawling that takes place in the book is hard to follow. But perhaps this is deliberate on Merritt's part. Not all of our questions are concretely answered by the novel's end, and Graydon's theorizing is apparently meant to suffice. But I suppose that this is all nitpicking. What &quot;Face&quot; ultimately does succeed at is in providing action-packed escapism, constant imagination and colorful wonders. What an incredible Hollywood blockbuster this would make! Anyway, as it is, this is yet another fine fantasy from Abraham Merritt."

I won't spoil the whole story but I will say this, the imagery is fantastic. I was able to picture vividly, so much of what Merritt describes in this book. I will also say that for me, this book went very quicly. Though not a simple book, it is easy to read.

I highly recomend this bible!For small group leaders: This bible contains a variety of ways for you to use it in your small group. There are margin questions for every passage of scripture in the entire bible. These questions include a ""warm up"" discussion question, ""dig and reflect"" questions and also ""application"" questions. I have found that these questions do an excelent job of helping to look at the important aspects of a passage and what meaning it might have for our lives.You may choose to study a single book of the bible using these margin questions and the study outline found at the begining of each book of the bible outlineing how many weeks the study will take and which passages to study on which week.There are topical studies outlined in the front of the bible which present options for topical study such as ""Parables of Jesus"" or ""Life in the Promised Land"".There are also studies outlined for various needs. Women's groups, men's groups, youth, etc. will find a section specificaly suggesting studies on topics of interest to those groups.Other need based studies include a variety of options including Marriage, parenting, ""marketplace"" - faith in business/job/etc., and recovery.For individuals:Although this bible is not a ""Study Bible"" in the sense that most people think of, I have found that I personaly much perfer this aspect of the bible. Because it does not have inretpretive or application notes, it allows me to read the text without being distracted by all the subscript notations. When i do have questions on a passage I usualy find that the questions located in the margin are sufficiently targeted to suggest ways to interpret or understand the passage. Often times the questions will refer you to another scripture passge that sheds light on the current one.However, if you are looking for a traditional ""Study Bible"" that provides notes or interpretations of a passge, this is not the bible for you.I love this bible for all the aspects I use it for. Bible study, group study, personal reading... It has been a favorite of mine, and everyone I recomend it to has been pleased as well."

1551665069,Titanic: A Love Story,,,,9/9,1.0,912643200,The &quot;lust boat&quot;,"I've learned in reading this book that there's a line not to be crossed when fictionalizing heroes. There's nothing I've seen or read about Captain E.J. Smith to support the sexually preoccupied &quot;interior life&quot; the author proposes for him, or that he'd externalize it by cheating on his wife. I don't see the man being a rule breaker at all. I picture him a genuine gentleman, rather conservative, and deeply attached to his wife and daughter. I COULD see E.J. meeting someone aboard whom he became close to during his final voyage -- only to learn at the awful end to his surprise that he cares alot more for this lady than he'd ever thought possible -- but I DON'T see him actually cheating.This is a strange book, running several plotlines with characters all involved in romantic entanglements of one sort or another. For example, there are two upper-class young ladies, twins named Smoke and Swan (is it my imagination, or does anyone else picture hookers with names like that?) who both fall in love with the same man -- a ficticious, very young third violinist from TITANIC's band. At one point, this young man is actually down in the band's bunk room &quot;in amours&quot; with one of the girls (which one escapes me at the moment)and he does eventually get caught out and fired -- cutting him loose from performing with the Magnificent Eight during their Immortal Last Gig so he can play out his preoccupation with Smoke/Swan. (which ever.)I think what turned me off about the book in the main was the lack of genuine emotional connection. This struck me as far more a &quot;lust&quot; story than a &quot;love&quot; story, and I guess I don't see TITANIC as a forum for that sort of thing. I think it would have played out much better aboard a totally fictional ship with a totally fictional crew. (names similar, but different.) To be fair, the writing style is engaging, but the interpretations of the historical characters continually jarred me. I recommend this book to all those out there who are thinking about writing fiction about TITANIC's real passengers and crew: it's a good example of what NOT to do -- at least if you want to be taken seriously!"

I was tricked into reading a romance novel! This &quot;book&quot; was originally titled Icefall, but was changed in order to jump on the Titanic bandwagon. rs. O'Cork wants us to beleive that Bruce Ishmay was gay and that Captain Smith was too busy making out with a divorcee to go on the ship. The ending is a travesty and the main characters are atrocious, there are actually twins named Smoke and Swan. If any body gets a copy of this book just throw in the bottom of a lake, it'll serve it's purpose better there than in your hands"
1551665069,Titanic: A Love Story,,,,5/5,1.0,940291200,I give it no stars,"This book, in a word, sucked. She paints Captain Smith as being a man who couldn't think about anything but sex, Bruce Ismay as being homosexual (maybe he was but I don't want to know about it!!!) and why on earth did she name those two girls SWAN and SMOKE!!??I just couldn't get past that..."
1551665069,Titanic: A Love Story,,,,4/4,1.0,902620800,Actually one-half star is more accurate,Ms. O'Cork does a real disservice to the actual people on board the Titanic and to any reader who has genuine interest in the historical facts. She could just as easily have written a completely fictional book with all characters and the ship itself being only similar to the actual event and not extrapolated from the real thing.

1551665069,Titanic: A Love Story,,,,3/3,2.0,898473600,Not for the serious Titanic collector,"Miss O'Cork's novel is advertised as a romance. That much is true. There is so much romance going on that it's no wonder the Titanic ran into an iceberg. If you are a collector of books about the Titanic, pass on this one. If the typical romance novel interests you, then Titanic will probably fit the bill."
1551665069,Titanic: A Love Story,,,,3/3,1.0,899683200,An early version of the Love Boat,"I believe, that when a person writes a work of fiction that involves historical characters, they should at least try to make the actions of those characters at least somewhat consistent with their known actions. This is not the case with this novel. If you care about the story of the Titanic, you will probably find this treatment of the tragedy disturbing for it inaccuracy and innuendo. If you don't care about the disaster, the romance might be interesting, but please don't believe anything about any of the characters."
1551665069,Titanic: A Love Story,,A1PKBFLJR4ZISE,"TitanicLights ""TitanicBuffExtraordinaire""",5/6,1.0,1129075200,The Absolute WORST Titanic Novel In History,"I didn't have the option of giving this mess no star so I had to give it one...I don't honestly think it even rates that, though.This is absolutely the WORST Titanic novel in history!!It's a shame that Captain Smith doesn't have descendents because if he did, they should sue Ms. O'Corke for defamation of character. Smith is portrayed as a satyr with a decided taste for kinky sex. To be honest, it is a disgraceful portrayal of the man. I am no apologist for Smith, but his sins have to do with the way in which TITANIC was navigated and NOT with what he allegedly did or did not do in the privacy of his cabi-- or anyone else's.Then there is the hack job done on J. Bruce Ismay --his family should definitely consider a day in court!I don't know if the guy was gay or not and I don't frankly care! There is plenty of interesting historical materiel about the man which could have been used to good effect in this novel rather than having him supposedly take advantage of a man who is not only drunk out of his skull but obviously distraught over some news which he has received. I know everyone seems to want to ""diss"" Ismay but this is really a bit much!For the rest of it: two girls named Smoke and Swan? Did this woman have ANY idea of the age she is writing about? Trust me on this one, folks--a family as uppercrust as the Brockhursts would NOT be likely to give their daughters such names. There would also be little chance of musicians and nubile first class passengers dallying together, no matter how good a plot it might seem at first.The next time that Ms O'Cork undertakes to write a historical novel, I suggest that she undertakes research before writing it or it will end up as big a turkey as ""Titanic--A Love Story"". I rarely give novels a bad review as I actually enjoy reading good historical fiction. Unfortunately, I cannot include this book in that category. This book isn't worth the paper it is written on!"

Thinking back then, I am sure my parents meant well when they bought me this, knowing how much I liked history and I had enjoyed the Titanic movie.I enjoyed the book back then, but now I can see why people have reviewed this book so negatively. Some of the scenarios in here push the line at what could be realistic. Several real historical figures on the Titanic are featured here, but I did not make the connection back then, this book makes these people seem like lustful maniacs, there was no need to do this to actual men or women aboard the ship. I did question back then why twin girls from an uppercrust family were called Smoke and Swan. Glad to know I'm not the only person who noticed these, I only just recently discovered the other reviews here on Amazon as I decided to write a review for this book.I'm not going to give this book one star because this is an enjoyable book for those not interested in historical accuracy, it's more of a guilty novel than any serious story about the Titanic."

But then I got into it, and realized how much lies in this story. It is very much complex, so I am surprised that it would be designated as a kid story, for though I may be a teen, I am a huge fan of Farley's work. There's so much story here. And it's simply amazing. This story tells of a son of The Black, who's given to Alec Ramsay for taking care of his father. But Satan, as he is named, turns out to be a wild killer, just like his father was before he met Alec. This horse had to go through a desperate situation that kept me guessing until the end, and the rage, but how he seemed to really try to make an effort to stop himself, clearly demonstrates the battle between good and evil in one creature's heart. That is one of the things that I think Farley is trying to tell us in this great book of the series.

The son of the black stallion - Satan - is so terrible at the beginning of the book that Henry doesn't want him around Alec. Henry sees something in the colt's stony gaze that makes him think that this horse is a demon, worse than his sire. Alec doesn't believe him, thinking that 'oh, this is my horse, he'll fall in love with me like the Black did'. The thing is, it doesn't work that way. And even after the horse is saved by Alec, he shouldn't all of a sudden act like he trusts the boy. If anything, in my experience with horses, the animal would be much more skittish than ever with someone connected to that event. Henry in particular, yes, but Alec too since he was around.

I started reading the series because Multiple Listings concerned Realtors. I thought she nailed us. :) My interest in her character has grown with each book. Cuttings concerns the floral industry (which I found to be surprisingly fascinating), and I was grabbed from the first page. The plot had a very unexpected turn, at least for me, and I loved it. It was one of those slap your forehead and say DUH times. The clues were there, but Grant had me so caught up in the story I missed them. It is a wonderful mystery that gives us a glimpse into the new urban south of Charlotte. I love Sydney and highly recommend this book and the first two Multiple Listing and Smoke Screen. You might as well buy them all while you are here, because you'll come back for them. Cuttings is a must read for mystery lovers."

Sidney is a single mother of two who runs her public relations agency with the help of two staffers and a revolving door of salespeople. And instead of a house by the Atlantic or some other attractive location, Teague works out of Charlotte, N.C. Those who know the area will recognize the locations, the people and Grant's cutting knowledge of the city's foibles, from its inability to distinguish itself nationally to its overweening pride in being a &quot;big city.&quot; The only bow to convention -- her boyfriend is a homicide detective -- is undercut by her uncertainty that they have a future together.So Teague lives a life that's closer to the everyday hurly-burly that her readers will find familiar. Her time is not her own, even when there's a murder to be solved. During a long weekend servicing a convention of florists, their wholesalers and suppliers, she has to cope with her demanding client, her employees and her children. On top of that, she is shaken when a floral designer she had known for decades suddenly drops dead at a seminar he was conducting. Then a convention executive is found stabbed, and Teague finds herself targeted as well. She soldiers on, but she's clearly shaken, and her subsequent discoveries carries with them an air of tragedy far graver and more satisfying than one would expect to find in a paperback. If Anne Underwood Grant doesn't take care, she may find herself compared with Patricia Cornwell and James Lee Burke. And who would want that?"

A recovering alcoholic and Friend of Bill W, the murders that occur at a Charleston flower show and a &quot;list&quot; with Sydney as fourth victim makes the temptation to return to the bottle strong, but not irresistable. Her recent foray into being a non-smoker is more problematic as the bodies pile up and she gets more signals that she may be next. Her first concern is her two children. She then wonders if her lover, homicide detective Tom, doesn't have something else on his mind besides finding the murder and protecting her. A fascinating look at the retail flower business is never overdone. Even when the murder is discovered, Sydney realizes that there are no easy solutions for her. Highly recommended."

The painful events he has happen to him in the first chapter when he's merely off to deliver a birthday card to a bargirl are the best introduction to both the story and Calvino himself. As expected, the other characters, some based on real expats in Bangkok, are just as believable and just as easy to love or loathe or sometimes do both at the same time; this is indeed a brilliant writing characteristic of Christopher G. Moore. If this book proceeds for you the way it did for me, you'll wipe it out within a day or two but if you're anywhere in Thailand when you do, you might be in a bar, sipping a beer or some Mekhong and feel as though you've transported yourself into the heart of Moore's writing and that Vinnie will be joining you soon for a whiskey himself.

If you haven't heard of this author, that's because he lives and work in Thailand. This is one of many novels from the Calvino series. I've read his previous Calvino novel Comfort Zone but I enjoyed this one even more. This is a must read book for any one who plan to take a trip to Thailand especially if your visit is not just business but also for pleasure. Christopher Moore seems to have a grasp the understanding of not just the Thai culture but also the Thai psyche. Example of this in the book is the Thai nightlife of the bars and the Ying(s) the book realistically portrayed the sights and sounds and the lights of Bangkok's nightlife in Soi Sukhumvit district. Also,it realistically relates to the sign of time when more and more people are exploring their sexual pleasures through the Internet. It was from this idea that the book start out with the new and innovative way in the technology of the net, which lured the foreign tourists to their deaths. The book takes you from that point on a roller coaster ride adventure through the eyes of an American Private Eyes Calvino. In this book, Calvino and his new found partner LAPD officer Jessada. Officer Jesseda who is Thai but grew up in L.A. joined the finest Police Department in the world... The LAPD. The two characters, through their fate and destiny, became partners working together to solve the mysteries in to the deaths of dth efive tourists and the over lined truth in the evilness of human greed &amp; the profit of ever ending battle in law enforcement...Narcotics.The author (although living in Thailand) did his research in writing this book by coming to Los Angeles and interviewed various crime fighting cops of the LAPD.

What makes this tale intriguing is its setting, among the ""for hire"" ladies in Bangkok and those who feed on them. In a nod to the noir tradition of Sam Spade, this novel bridges the Pacific between Los Angeles and Bangkok in an effective way.Sexual tourists are flocking to Bangkok and some of them are ending up in a coffin. Calvino wants to know what's going on while everyone else ignores these deaths.Calvino knows that if something sounds too good to be true . . . it surely is . . . but he keeps getting sucker punched in the process because he's on his uppers and needs the cash.First he's hired to deliver a birthday card for $150. Then he's asked to be a body guard for a thousand dollars a day. Who wouldn't be tempted? Caveat detective!The story has many twists and turns that are nicely tied together before the book ends. There's no lack of action.The book positively swims in paid-for sex for exploitive men. I doubt if many women will find this book to be appealing.The best part of the book comes in its development of Thai psychology. The subtlety and realism of the views are interesting to contemplate.The story's main weakness is its slow development in the last 100 pages or so. This material was pretty predictable and could have been edited down to good effect.This book will be most appealing to those who always wanted to take a vacation in a house of ill repute."

0262011859,Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication,,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,magellan,66/67,5.0,1072224000,Excellent intro text,"This is the second edition and fourth printing of this popular text by Akmajian, Demers, and Harnish at the University of Arizona. Although this text is now over 15 years old, it's still a fine introduction to the subject. One nice thing about the book is that the prose is not too technical for the beginning reader while providing excellent coverage of the important concepts and technical points. This is often a problem with linguistics texts since, unlike other technical subjects, most people have little or no background in linguistics before taking their first real course in the subject, and having previously learned a foreign language isn't as helpful as many students might think since much of linguistics, especially in the transformational grammar and generative grammar and analytical syntax areas, is a highly technical, formal, and even mathematical discipline now.As I am mainly a neuroscientist and secondarily a linguist, I was most interested in Part 3 of this book. The first two parts present the usual linguistics topics such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language variation, and evolution. Part 3 deals with the area of Psycholinguistics, and there are four chapters discussing language from the standpoint of Cognitive Psychology and Neuropsychology. The four chapters are: Pragmatics: The Study of Language Use and Communication; Speech Production and Comprehension; Language Acquisition in Chimp and Child;, and Language and the Brain. The chapter on the brain might be a little too basic for neuroscience students, but it's an excellent introduction for the linguistics students, and I noticed that a number of the classic experiments such as the famous &quot;Wada test&quot; and dichotic listening experiments were discussed, as well as topics like conduction aphasia, Broca's aphasia, Wernicke's aphasia, hemispheric localization and dominance, and so on.Overall still a fine text and worth picking up used if you can find it, when it will be bargain for the price."

0870540858,New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos,,A173B3M8WJ9WZI,"W. H. Pugmire ""H. P. Lovecraft Rools Okay!""",4/4,5.0,1263513600,A Great Cthulhu Mythos Anthology,"(This review contains spoilers -- caution is advised.)""The final section of the transcript was considerably more interesting, however; it recorded a number of brief scenes that must never have appeared in the finished film. I quote one of them in its entirety:PLAYROOM, CHURCH SCHOOL -- LATE AFTERNOON.(DELETED)INT: This Malay youth has sketched a picture of a demon he calls Shoo Goron.(To boy) I wonder if you can tell me something about the instrument he'sblowing out of. It looks like the Jewish shofar, or ram's horn. (Againto Boy) That's all right. No need to be frightened.BOY: He no blow out. Blow in.INT: I see -- he draws air in through the horn, is that right?BOY: No horn. Is no horn. (Weeps) Is HIM,""That is one of many fine moments in one of the greatest Lovecraftian tales ever penned, ""Black Man With A Horn,"" by T. E. D. Klein. The story had its first publication in this excellent anthology of Mythos fiction edited by Ramsey Campbell for Arkham House. Every time I return to ""Black Man With a Horn"" it stuns me with its brilliance, similar to the effect of rereading Karl Edward Wagner's classic ""Sticks."" The tale is told in first person, and it is structured in similar fashion to the way H. P. Lovecraft himself structured tales such as ""The Call of Cthulhu,"" with bits of quotations and news articles and revelations that, piled up, paint a terrifying portrait of supernatural horror. There are many wonderful references to Lovecraft, and here and there we are delighted with a wee quotation from one of HPL's letters (the story begins with the epigraph,""The Black (words obscured by postmark) was fascinating--I must get a snap shot of him.""--H. P. Lovecraft, postcard to E. Hoffmann Price, 7/23/1934;and this combination of fanciful play, a wink of the Lovecraftian eye, with a tale that grows more and more terrifying, is delicious. Every time I return to this tale I am tempted to call it my all-time favourite Mythos tale written by someone other than H. P. Lovecraft (a position held by Robert Bloch's magnificent ""The Shadow from the Steeple"").Ramsey Campbell's first book was an Arkham House hardcover that was published when he was 19 years old, and it was a collection of Cthulhu Mythos stories. He has now become one of the genre's masters, hailed by some as the most important weird fiction writer since Lovecraft. Although he went through a phase where he tried to write tales that shewed absolutely no Lovecraftian influence, he has, now and again, returned to the Mythos mode. For this book he penned a great wee tale, ""The Faces at Pine Dunes."" Unlike some modern writers, who feel that the only way to approach the Lovecraftian tale is to treat it with humor, Ramsey's approach is almost always dead serious, and thus chilling. Ramsey has a wonderful talent for evoking a dark and haunting sense of place, and he does so with brilliance in this fine tale.One curious fragment in the oeuvre of H. P. Lovecraft is ""The Book,"" a thwarted attempt by HPL to write a weird tale based on the opening three poems in his ""Fungi from Yuggoth"" sonnet sequence. With ""The Black Tome of Alsophocus,"" Martin S. Warnes has completed HPL's fragment, and the tale is published under a dual bi-line with Lovecraft's name first. Such a practice cannot be considered a success unless the living author captures the essence of Lovecraft's singular style. This is something that Derleth tried to do, but could not accomplish, in his less-than-inspired (with some few exceptions) ""posthumous collaborations"" that are collected in THE WATCHERS OUT OF TIME. Happily, Mr. Warnes succeeds where Derleth did not, and he gives us a tale that is purely Lovecraftian. One wishes that Robert M. Price had included this tale of the Crawling Chaos in his Chaosium Cycle anthology, THE NYARLATHOTEP CYCLE.I have not yet read any of the many fantasy novels penned by A. A. Attanasio, but I quite enjoy his magnificent tales of the Cthulhu Mythos and have long wished to see an entire book under his bi-line of such tales. (The only other tale of his that I remember reading was ""Glimpses,"" which Gerald W. Page included in his fine Arkham House anthology, DARK THINGS, 1975.) His tale in this book, ""The Star Pools,"" is a rousing adventure story with a subtle Mythos subtext, and it is enormously effective. He has a wonderful talent for characterization and dialogue that one does not always find in Mythos tales.Other tales include: ""Crouch End,"" a rather silly yet entertaining tale by Stephen King; ""The Second Wish,"" by Brian Lumley; ""Dark Awakening,"" by Frank Belknap Long; ""Shaft Number 247,"" by Basil Copper, and one of the scariest Lovecraftian tales that I have ever read, brilliant; and ""Than Curse the Darkness,"" by David Drake. The cover illustration of the Arkham House hardcover is a delightful work by Jason Van Hollander -- I especially love the landscape of Kingsport as portray'd on ye back cover. Editor Campbell has also supplied an interesting introduction in which he pens a wee history of the Mythos. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in seeing what modern authors have done with this imaginary landscape spill'd from ye mind of our finest dreamer, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, Esq."

With an MA in Psychology among other certifications, Louise Crawford uses her therapeutic experience as a backdrop in her third Blaize/Zoloski mystery. The result, long in pop-psychology and various twelve-step program jargons becomes a bit heavy handed at times, but the overall story is enjoyable.In this third installment of the series, Blaize is trying to figure out her relationship with the man she affectionately refers to as Z-man: Zoloski. The Police Detective and her lover has set an ultimatum for her concerning their future and wants her to commit to getting married. Because of her history of brutal abuse at the hands of her family, the idea of marriage is overwhelming.At the same time, some of her extended family seems to want to reconnect, years after her father's death as well as her running away from home. Hardly before she has a chance to consider that possibility, Uncle Rich who was responsible for quite a lot of the abuse, is found murdered. Quickly, both Blaize and her brother Ian who has some shocking revelations of his own are considered suspects. With most of the clues pointing to Ian, Blaize can't leave things alone. She begins to dig and soon discovers that the abuse never stopped and the list of suspects with motive to kill is long and complex.This novel is driven nearly entirely by discussions of abuse and therapy. Almost every character is extremely dysfunctional by anyone's standards and there are several stretches where different kinds of addiction are discussed and explained in great detail. For the average reader who is interested in such topics, the bibliography at the conclusion of the novel is a big help. However, while the novel is enjoyable, for readers who are looking for sheer escapism, this novel is not for you.Acknowledging the fact that this novel is fairly heavy handed at times in advocating therapy for any and all problems, it must be also said that it is well written and deals with the issues it raises in a compassionate manner. With so much reliance on therapy issues, the action is limited, but what action there is serves to move the story along. Overall, it is an enjoyable read and with the brief explanations of events in the first two novels, it works as a stand alone novel from the series."

Nestor Burma, captured French soldier and former private detective, is working as a clerk in Stalag XB when he meets a mysterious amnesiac nicknamed ""La Globule."" B&eacute;bert, another captured conscript, tells Burma that his unit found the severely injured unknown in civilian clothes in the countryside, just before their capture by the Germans. La Globule dies telling Burma: ""Dites a H&eacute;lene... 120 Rue de la Gare!"" The address is also the last words of Burma's former colleague, Bob Colomer, who is shot greeting Burma upon his 1941 discharge into occupied France. Just before the murder Burma sees a woman holding a gun - she is identified as former actress Madeleine Moraine.Strange and significant dreams begin to plague Burma. Who is H&eacute;lene? Who was La Globule? Is Moraine the murderer? What is their connection with the late jewel thief, Jo Tour Eiffel? Burma's mentor, Montbrison, has only dead ends and red herrings to offer the detective as he follows the twisted trail leading to 120 Rue de la Gare.This is a highly enjoyable hard-boiled mystery with a lot of twists and turns. The `casting call' finale is a bit clich&eacute;d, and the story as a whole somewhat text heavy, but Tardi pulls it off as always with splendid characterization and period detail. Highly recommended!"

The research consisted of going across the US and spending a morning, afternoon, or an evening in the best &quot;bar bars&quot; in the city. No fern bars or pick up joints allowed. Each reviewed bar is rated using the Atkinson System ( between one and five points in such areas as Yuppie sightings (bad) &quot;A little something to wash down my drink with&quot; (food) and lighting. (bright=bad dark=good). My only gripe is that there are not enough bars reviewed, but hey, it's not MY liver doing the research. Also, the New Orleans section was rather spotty due to the research getting a little too intense. Atkinson explains this away as being due to the fact that &quot;New Orleans--the entire TOWN is a bar bar.&quot; Also included along with the bar bar reviews is the Atkinson Field Guide, which includes tips on bar bar etiquette, species notes on bar bar regulars (these include Mr. Knowsitall, The Scoremaster, and Captain 86, who is always just on the edge of getting banned from the establishment.

I think it's one of the funniest books I've ever read, and it's certainly one of the most original.Let's be plain -- as a guide to bars, the book is out of date, and even when current, the bars it covered were NOT bars for the average person. But none of that really matters because &quot;The View From Nowhere&quot; is much MORE than a guidebook. It's really a way of looking at life.
