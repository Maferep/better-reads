Cosmopolis: the Hidden Agenda of Modernity,"In the seventeenth century, a vision arose which was to captivate the Western imagination for the next three hundred years: the vision of Cosmopolis, a society as rationally ordered as the Newtonian view of nature. While fueling extraordinary advances in all fields of human endeavor, this vision perpetuated a hidden yet persistent agenda: the delusion that human nature and society could be fitted into precise and manageable rational categories. Stephen Toulmin confronts that agenda—its illusions and its consequences for our present and future world. ""By showing how different the last three centuries would have been if Montaigne, rather than Descartes, had been taken as a starting point, Toulmin helps destroy the illusion that the Cartesian quest for certainty is intrinsic to the nature of science or philosophy.""—Richard M. Rorty, University of Virginia ""[Toulmin] has now tackled perhaps his most ambitious theme of all. . . . His aim is nothing less than to lay before us an account of both the origins and the prospects of our distinctively modern world. By charting the evolution of modernity, he hopes to show us what intellectual posture we ought to adopt as we confront the coming millennium.""—Quentin Skinner, New York Review of Books","['Stephen Toulmin', 'Stephen Edelston Toulmin']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6bYgQ26xGXMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6bYgQ26xGXMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cosmopolis:+the+Hidden+Agenda+of+Modernity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,1992-11,http://books.google.com/books?id=6bYgQ26xGXMC&dq=Cosmopolis:+the+Hidden+Agenda+of+Modernity&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0
Across the River and Into the Trees - Jonathan Cape Publishers - 1950 - True First Edition,"In the fall of 1948, Ernest Hemingway made his first extended visit to Italy in thirty years. His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for Across the River and into the Trees, the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him ""the most important author since Shakespeare.""",['Ernest Hemingway'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Across+the+River+and+Into+the+Trees+-+Jonathan+Cape+Publishers+-+1950+-+True+First+Edition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2002-07-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],15.0

Strange Jazz,"From plucking antique furniture from abandoned rural Kansas homes, to exploring the wild underbelly of New York, narrator Jack Pierce describes the decline of his hometown and the kaleidoscopic New York he's privy to as a music critic. Jack is troubled by the rising tension between his two younger brothers: Benji -- a quintessential Wall Street Yuppie bent on becoming the next Donald Trump -- and Archie -- an idealistic intern at the New York Times. Archie and Benji clash after the Tompkins Square Riots, when Archie turns Benji's largest building into a shelter for homeless people. When Benji finds out, he takes matters into his own hands. Jack tries to mediate, only to be kidnapped by a female Coca-Cola-addicted drug lord who develops a crush on Jack. Jazz, poetry, the wheat fields of Kansas, the colorful cast of characters from their dying home town, the edgiest and most beautiful New Yorkers, all are notes and chords in this wonderful symphony of a novel.",['Steve Hermanos'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m9copKG9nPYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=m9copKG9nPYC&pg=PR7&dq=Strange+Jazz&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,iUniverse,2001-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=m9copKG9nPYC&dq=Strange+Jazz&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
